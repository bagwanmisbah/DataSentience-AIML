# Comment Classification – Psychotic Depression Detection

This module contains an implementation for classifying **social media comments** as related to **psychotic depression** or not.  
It demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for mental health text analysis.

---

## 📂 Files
- `comments_classification.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full implementation (preprocessing, training, evaluation).
- `README.md` – documentation and usage guide.

---

## 🚀 Usage
1. Navigate into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd "src/Social Media/CommentClassification"
Open the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook comments_classification.ipynb
Run the cells step by step to:

Preprocess and clean text data

Extract features (e.g., TF-IDF/embeddings)

Train the classification model

Evaluate performance on sample data

🛠 Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

nltk (if used for text preprocessing)

Install them with:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(You can generate requirements.txt by running pip freeze > requirements.txt in your environment.)

📊 Example
The notebook trains a classification pipeline and outputs evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🌱 Future Improvements
Add deep learning–based models (e.g., LSTMs, transformers)

Expand dataset with more annotated comments

Provide pre-trained model weights for reuse

🤝 Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you’d like to extend or improve this module.

👉 Do you want me to also extract the **exact list of dependencies from your notebook** (`comments_classification.ipynb`) so you’ll have a ready-made `requirements.txt` file for your PR?

Nice 🚀 you’re almost done!
Let’s push your new README (and the notebook if it’s not committed yet) to your fork so you can open the PR.

🔹 Steps to push your changes
Make sure you’re on your feature branch

bash
Copy code
git checkout add-comment-classification
Check what’s changed

bash
Copy code
git status
You should see your new README.md (and maybe the notebook).

Stage the changes

bash
Copy code
git add "src/Social Media/CommentClassification/README.md"
git add "src/Social Media/CommentClassification/comments_classification.ipynb"
(You can also do git add . if you want to stage all changes in the folder.)

Commit

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "docs: add README for comment classification module"
Push to your fork

bash
Copy code
git push origin add-comment-classification
🔹 Next step
Go to your fork on GitHub.

You should see a “Compare & pull request” button for add-comment-classification.

Click it → paste the PR description we prepared → submit 🚀

Do you want me to also give you the exact sequence of commands in one block (so you can copy-paste and not miss a step)?
