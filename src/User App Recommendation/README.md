# App Usage Recommender System

Welcome to the **App Usage Recommender System** project! This project leverages user interaction data to build a personalized app suggestion engine using item-based collaborative filtering. Through meticulous data cleaning, exploration, and modeling, the system can recommend new apps tailored to individual user preferences with high accuracy.

---

## 📄 Overview

- **Purpose:** To develop a recommender system that suggests apps to users based on their usage patterns.
- **Approach:** Memory-based, item-based collaborative filtering.
- **Outcome:** A trained model capable of providing personalized app recommendations with good accuracy.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** App usage dataset containing user interactions, app launches, timestamps, and other relevant features.
- **Processing:**
  - Extensive data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand user behaviors, app popularity, and usage patterns.
  - Feature engineering to derive meaningful metrics such as screentime, interaction counts, and normalized ratings.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Created a user-item interaction matrix capturing user engagement with apps.
- Normalized interaction metrics to generate ratings for each user-app pair.

### 2. Model Building
- Calculated app-to-app similarities using cosine similarity.
- Developed functions to generate recommendations based on similarity scores.
- Ensured the model is scalable and efficient for real-time recommendations.

### 3. Evaluation
- Measured the model's accuracy using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between predicted and actual interactions.
- Fine-tuned parameters to enhance recommendation quality.
