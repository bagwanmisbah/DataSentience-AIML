# ðŸª¨ Rock Vs Mine Classification Using Machine Learning

This project is a binary classification task that aims to distinguish between sonar signals bounced off **mines** and **rocks** using supervised machine learning algorithms. It demonstrates a practical application of signal classification and includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))
- **Instances**: 208
- **Attributes**: 60 numerical features representing sonar energy in various frequency bands
- **Target Classes**:
  - `R` = Rock
  - `M` = Mine

The sonar returns are captured at different angles and frequencies, and each instance is labeled accordingly.

## ðŸ§  Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Why?** Simple, interpretable, and effective for linear decision boundaries.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Label encoding of target variable (`R` to 0, `M` to 1)
  - Train-Test split (80-20)
  - Standardization of features using `StandardScaler`

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report**
- **Manual Prediction Validation**

Example Output:
