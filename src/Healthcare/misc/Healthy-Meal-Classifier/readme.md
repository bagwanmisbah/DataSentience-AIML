# Healthy Meal Classifier Project

## Overview of theProject

The project is a Machine Learning project that classifies meals as *healthy* or *unhealthy* based on nutritional and ingredient data. It uses Python data analysis libraries for preprocessing and a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction.

## What we do in this project?

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales numerical features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for insights.
* **Model Training**: Random Forest Classifier to predict meal healthiness.
* **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy score and classification report.
* **Customizable**: Can be adapted for other types of food classification tasks.
