# 💡 Medical Insurance Cost Predictor

This project predicts medical insurance costs based on user input features like age, BMI, smoking status, region, etc. The goal is to understand which features influence insurance charges and to use machine learning models to make accurate predictions.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Takes in user features such as age, BMI, and smoking status.
- Trains different machine learning models to predict medical insurance costs.
- Compares the performance of the models.
- Uses the best-performing model to make final predictions.

## 🧪 Models Tested

We tested multiple machine learning models including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

The model that gave the best performance was selected for final predictions.

## 📓 How to Use the Notebook

1. **Open the notebook** in Google Colab or Jupyter:
   - If you're on GitHub: click on the `.ipynb` file and select **"Open in Colab"** (if available).
   - Or manually upload the file to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Run the cells** one by one:
   - The notebook is self-contained with explanations.
   - It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and final prediction.

3. **Modify inputs** at the bottom to try your own test cases.
