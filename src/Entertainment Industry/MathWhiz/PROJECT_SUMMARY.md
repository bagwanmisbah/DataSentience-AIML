# 🧮 MathWhiz Project Summary

## 📋 Overview

MathWhiz is a complete AI-powered mathematical expression generator and step-by-step solver built using Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models. The project demonstrates how to create synthetic training data and train neural networks to solve mathematical problems with human-readable explanations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Generation** (`data/generator.py`)
   - Synthetic math expression generator
   - Supports linear equations, polynomial simplification, arithmetic expressions
   - Auto-generates step-by-step solutions
   - 100% synthetic dataset - no external data required

2. **Math Solver** (`utils/math_solver.py`)
   - Ground truth solution generator
   - Step-by-step mathematical reasoning
   - Solution verification capabilities
   - Supports multiple mathematical operations

3. **Tokenizer** (`model/tokenizer.py`)
   - Custom tokenizer for mathematical expressions
   - Handles mathematical symbols, operators, and step descriptions
   - Vocabulary building from training data
   - Encoding/decoding functionality

4. **Models**
   - **LSTM Seq2Seq** (`model/seq2seq_lstm.py`): Bidirectional LSTM with attention
   - **Transformer** (`model/transformer.py`): Transformer-based alternative
   - Both models support teacher forcing and inference

5. **Training** (`training/train_seq2seq.py`)
   - Complete training pipeline
   - Data loading and preprocessing
   - Model checkpointing
   - Training visualization

6. **Evaluation** (`evaluation/evaluate.py`)
   - Multiple evaluation metrics
   - Accuracy, BLEU score, step-by-step correctness
   - Detailed results analysis
