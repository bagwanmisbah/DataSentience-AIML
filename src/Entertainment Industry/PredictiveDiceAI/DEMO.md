## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

### **Scoring Engine Performance**
- **Basic scoring**: 100 points per 1, 50 points per 5
- **Three of a kind**: 200-1000 points based on value
- **Special combinations**: Straight (1500), Three pairs (1500)
- **Advanced combinations**: Four/Five/Six of a kind (1000-3000)

### **AI Capabilities**
- **State representation**: 50-dimensional tensor encoding

- **Network architecture**: 256→256→128 hidden layers
- **Training efficiency**: Batch processing with experience replay

## 🎮 **Game Rules**

### **Standard Dice Game Rules**
1. **Roll 6 dice** to start each turn
2. **Score dice** that match scoring rules
3. **Keep dice** you want to preserve
4. **Reroll** remaining dice (up to 3 times)
5. **End turn** when you can't score or choose to stop
6. **Highest score** after 10 turns wins

### **Scoring Combinations**
- **Ones**: 100 points each
- **Fives**: 50 points each  
- **Three of a kind**: 200-1000 points
- **Straight**: 1-2-3-4-5-6 = 1500 points
- **Three pairs**: Any three pairs = 1500 points
