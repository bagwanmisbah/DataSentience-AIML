## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HoneypotAI.git
   cd HoneypotAI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

4. **Start the platform**
   ```bash
   python main.py --start-honeypot
   ```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t honeypotai .

# Run with default configuration
docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 2222:2222 -p 8080:8080 -p 2121:2121 honeypotai

# Run with custom configuration
docker run -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config honeypotai
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Honeypot Deployment

```python
from main import HoneypotAI

# Initialize the platform
honeypot_ai = HoneypotAI()

# Start all services
if honeypot_ai.start():
    print("HoneypotAI platform started successfully")
    
    # Get system status
    status = honeypot_ai.get_status()
    print(f"Active connections: {status['honeypot']['total_connections']}")
    print(f"Threats detected: {status['threat_detection']['total_detections']}")
    
    # Wait for shutdown
    honeypot_ai.wait_for_shutdown()
```

### Custom Threat Detection

```python
from ml import ThreatDetector
from ml import FeatureExtractor

# Initialize components
detector = ThreatDetector()
extractor = FeatureExtractor()

# Configure detection parameters
detector.setup_anomaly_detection(sensitivity=0.9)
detector.setup_attack_classification(confidence_threshold=0.95)

# Process connection logs
logs = [{"source_ip": "192.168.1.100", "service": "ssh", "payload": "admin:password"}]
features = extractor.extract_features(logs)
threats = detector.detect_threats(logs)

print(f"Detected {len(threats)} threats")
```

### Adaptive Response Configuration

```python
from adapt import AdaptiveResponse

# Initialize adaptive response
response = AdaptiveResponse()

# Configure response strategies
response.set_blocking_strategy("dynamic")
response.set_throttling_enabled(True)
response.set_decoy_responses(True)

# Handle detected threats
for threat in threats:
    response.handle_threat(threat)
```
