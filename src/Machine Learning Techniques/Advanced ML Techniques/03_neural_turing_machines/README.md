# Neural Turing Machines (NTMs)

## üß† **Overview**

Neural Turing Machines represent a groundbreaking fusion of neural networks with external memory systems, inspired by Alan Turing's theoretical computing machine. NTMs extend the capabilities of traditional neural networks by providing them with an external memory bank that can be read from and written to, enabling them to perform complex algorithmic tasks that require persistent storage and sequential reasoning.

## üéØ **Core Concept**

NTMs combine the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic power of Turing machines:

### **Key Components**
- **Controller Network**: Neural network (LSTM/Feedforward) that makes decisions
- **External Memory Bank**: Matrix of memory cells that can store information
- **Read/Write Heads**: Attention mechanisms that access specific memory locations
- **Addressing Mechanisms**: Content-based and location-based memory access

### **Fundamental Principles**
1. **Separation of Computation and Memory**: Neural processing separate from persistent storage
2. **Attention-Based Memory Access**: Selective reading and writing to memory locations
3. **Differentiable Memory Operations**: All operations are differentiable for end-to-end training
4. **Algorithmic Learning**: Learning to perform algorithmic tasks through examples

## üî¨ **Bizarre & Advanced Aspects**

### **1. External Memory Bank**
```python
class MemoryBank(nn.Module):
    """

    Key Properties:
    - Persistent across time steps

    The heads compute attention weights over memory locations:
    - Read head: Computes read weights w_r for memory reading
    - Write head: Computes write weights w_w for memory writing
    
    Addressing Mechanisms:
    1. Content-based addressing: Similarity between key and memory
    2. Location-based addressing: Spatial relationships in memory
