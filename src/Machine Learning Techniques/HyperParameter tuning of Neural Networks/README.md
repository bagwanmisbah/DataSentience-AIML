## Neural Network Hyperparameter Tuning with Keras Tuner

This notebook is designed to help beginners in Deep Learning understand how to improve a neural networkâ€™s performance using hyperparameter tuning. Instead of sticking with fixed parameters, we explore how different configurations (like optimizer, number of neurons, and hidden layers) affect accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Inside

A step-by-step guide starting from loading and preprocessing data.

Building a baseline Neural Network model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Using Keras Tuner to:

- Try different optimizers.

- Tune the number of units in hidden layers.

- Experiment with different network depths (hidden layers).

ðŸ”¹ Why Keras Tuner?

Training models with different hyperparameters manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Keras Tuner automates this trial-and-error process by:

- Running multiple experiments for you.

- Logging and tracking results.

- Suggesting the best hyperparameter set for maximum validation accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Impact

By the end of this notebook, you will:

- Understand how hyperparameters affect model performance.

- Learn to use Keras Tunerâ€™s RandomSearch to automate the tuning process.

- Be able to select the best performing model configuration and retrain it for maximum accuracy.

This makes the notebook a practical hands-on guide for learners who want to go beyond building neural networks and start optimizing them effectively.
