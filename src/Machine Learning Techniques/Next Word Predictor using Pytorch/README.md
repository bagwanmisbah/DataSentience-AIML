## LSTM Next Word Predictor

This notebook contains a PyTorch implementation of an LSTM-based next word prediction model. The notebook demonstrates how to:

- Preprocess text data using NLTK tokenization

- Build and train an LSTM model with PyTorch

- Generate predictions for the next word in a sequence

- Handle training with custom Dataset and DataLoader

It serves as a simple and beginner-friendly example of applying deep learning to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## Requirements

See requirements.txt for dependencies (torch, numpy, nltk).

NOTE: Everything is explained in comments to understand easily (Especially for beginners in Pytorch and LSTM Architecture).
