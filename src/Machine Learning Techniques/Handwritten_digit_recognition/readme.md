Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on image data and evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization.

Installation and Requirements
To install the required dependencies, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Required libraries include:

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

## Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

## Conclusion
The digit classification model achieved high performance with the following results:

Accuracy: ~98.36%

Precision: ~98.36%

Recall: ~98.36%

F1-Score: ~98.36%

The confusion matrix shows strong predictions with minimal misclassifications, making this model highly effective for digit recognition tasks.
