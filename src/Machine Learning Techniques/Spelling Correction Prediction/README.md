## PROJECT TITLE : SPELLING CORRECTOR

#### AIM

To correct spellings of words

#### DESCRIPTION

This is a problem where we need to correct the spellings of different misspelled words. We use Sequence to Sequence Encoder-Decoder Model Model.

#### DEPLOYMENT

StreamLit-Share = Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in Python. No front‑end experience required. Streamlit’s open-source app framework is a breeze to get started with. It is very easy to use. One just have to connect with the github repo and start deploying it on streamlit share and you are good to go.

#### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras
4. Joblib
5. re
6. Unicode
7. StreamLit

#### CONCLUSION

We can conclude that our Web App corrects misspelled words with the help of Sequence to Sequence Encoder-Decoder Model.
