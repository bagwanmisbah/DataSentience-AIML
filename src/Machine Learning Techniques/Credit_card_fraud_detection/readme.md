# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Goal  

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect 
fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset. 
The dataset contains anonymized transaction data, where the target variable indicates whether a 
transaction is fraudulent (`1`) or legitimate (`0`). The project handles class imbalance, 
performs model training and evaluation, and uses performance metrics to assess the model's
effectiveness.

## Installation and Requirements
