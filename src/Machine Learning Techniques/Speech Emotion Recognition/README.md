## Speech Emotion Recognition 🎙️

This notebook walks through building a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model on a voices dataset (Kaggle link inside the notebook). It’s written with beginners in mind, with clear explanations and visuals at every step.

## What’s Inside

- Preprocessing audio data with Librosa (MFCCs, spectrograms).
- Training a deep neural network with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Step-by-step guidance, supported by plots and visualizations.
- Final model reaches 99.4% accuracy 🎯.

## Why It’s Useful

- Explains not just the what but also the why behind each step.
- Great starting point if you’re new to deep learning for audio.
- Can be adapted for other voice or sound classification tasks.
