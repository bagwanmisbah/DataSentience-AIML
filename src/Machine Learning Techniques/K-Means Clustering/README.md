# K-Means Clustering from Scratch

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy and visualizes the results with Matplotlib.

## Features

- **K-Means from scratch:** The core K-Means algorithm is implemented in Python using NumPy.
- **Visualization:** The clustered data and centroids are visualized using Matplotlib.

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python kmeans_from_scratch.py
   ```

## Output

The script will generate a plot showing the data points colored by their assigned cluster and the final centroids marked with an 'X'.
