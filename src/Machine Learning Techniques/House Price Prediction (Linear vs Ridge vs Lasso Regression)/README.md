# 🏠 House Price Prediction Model using Ridge Regression

This project aims to build a **regression-based machine learning model** to predict **median house prices** in California. It uses the **California Housing Dataset** and compares **Linear**, **Ridge**, and **Lasso** Regression models. The final model selected is **Ridge Regression** for its performance and generalization capability.

---

## 📌 Objective

To predict housing prices based on factors like income, house age, population density, and location, and evaluate the model’s performance using real-world regression metrics and visualizations.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`
- **Target Variable**: `MedHouseVal` (Median house value in $100,000s)
- **Features**:
  - `MedInc`: Median Income
  - `HouseAge`: Median house age
  - `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms
  - `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms
  - `Population`: Block population
  - `AveOccup`: Average occupancy
  - `Latitude`, `Longitude`: Location coordinates

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Inspected data types, null values, and summary statistics.
- Visualized target variable distribution — it is **right-skewed**.
- Identified outliers in the target using **boxplots**.
- Decided to **retain outliers** to ensure model learns from high-value homes.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing

- **StandardScaler** applied to input features.
- Dataset split into **training and test sets**.
- Used **RidgeCV** for automated alpha selection in Ridge Regression.

## 🧠 Models Compared

| Model      | RMSE  | MAE   | R² Score |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Linear     | 0.745 | 0.533 | 0.575    |
| **Ridge**  | **0.745** | **0.533** | **0.576** |
| Lasso      | 0.746 | 0.533 | 0.574    |

✅ **Ridge Regression** was selected for its better R² score and robustness to multicollinearity.
