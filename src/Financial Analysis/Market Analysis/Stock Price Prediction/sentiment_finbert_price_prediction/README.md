# Sentiment FinBERT Stock Price Prediction

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that applies **FinBERT** (a BERT-based model 
trained for financial sentiment analysis) to predict stock prices by combining 
sentiment features with historical market data.

## Contents
- `finbert_stock_price_prediction.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, sentiment feature extraction, model training, and evaluation
- `README.md` → Documentation for this folder

## Workflow
1. Preprocess historical stock price data and financial text.
2. Extract sentiment features using FinBERT.
3. Train machine learning models with combined sentiment and price data.
4. Evaluate prediction accuracy and visualize results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install transformers pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Usage

Open and run the notebook:

jupyter notebook finbert_stock_price_prediction.ipynb

Notes

Ensure you have GPU support for faster FinBERT inference.

The notebook can be extended with different stock datasets or models.

## ✅ Final Pull Request Template

### Title


Add Sentiment FinBERT Stock Price Prediction notebook


### Description
```markdown
## Overview
This PR adds a new folder under:
`src/Financial Analysis/Market Analysis/Stock Price Prediction/`

The folder is named `sentiment_finbert_price_prediction` and contains a Jupyter notebook
implementing stock price prediction using **FinBERT**, a BERT-based model for financial sentiment analysis.

## Changes Made
- Created folder: `src/Financial Analysis/Market Analysis/Stock Price Prediction/sentiment_finbert_price_prediction/`
- Added `finbert_stock_price_prediction.ipynb` → notebook for preprocessing, sentiment feature extraction, model training, and evaluation
- Added `README.md` → explains the folder structure, workflow, and dependencies

## Why This Change?
- Introduces a modern NLP approach for enhancing stock price prediction with financial sentiment.
- Organizes code in a dedicated folder for easy maintainability and extension.
- Provides documentation to help future contributors quickly understand and build upon this work.

## Notes
- Dependencies: `transformers`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
- Tested locally with Python 3.9+
- Open for suggestions on naming conventions or additional improvements
