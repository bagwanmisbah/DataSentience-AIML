## UPI Fraud Detection 

## Project Overview

In today‚Äôs fast-paced, Gen-Z-driven world, UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions have become as common as sending a text. With this increase in digital payments, **fraudulent transactions have also seen a rise**. 

This project simulates a basic **UPI fraud detection system**, exploring how we can use machine learning to **identify suspicious transactions**.

## Machine Learning Models Used

We trained and compared the performance of **three supervised ML models**:

| Model              | Description                                       |
|------------------- |---------------------------------------------------|
| Decision Tree      | Easy-to-interpret tree model.                     |
| Random Forest      | Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy. |
| Gradient Boosting  | Sequential ensemble that corrects previous errors.|

## Why Accuracy Is NOT Enough

In fraud detection, **accuracy can be misleading**, especially if fraud cases are rare.

Let‚Äôs say:
- 98% of transactions are legit (non-fraud).
- A dumb model that says "everything is legit" will be 98% accurate.

But it **won‚Äôt detect any frauds**. That's why we consider:

| Metric      | Importance                                                                |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recall**  | Most important! How many actual frauds we correctly identified.           |
| **Precision**| Of all the frauds we predicted, how many were actually fraud.            |
| **F1 Score**| Balance between precision and recall.                                     |

## Model Evaluation Results

| Model      | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Decision Tree (dt_model) | 0.9077   | 0.7879    | 0.8387 | 0.8125   | 0.8840  |
| Random Forest (rf_model) | 0.9462   | 0.8750    | 0.9032 | 0.8889   | 0.9314  |
| Gradient Boosting (gb_model) | 0.9385   | 0.8286    | 0.9355 | 0.8788   | 0.9374  |

> üèÜ **Gradient Boosting** performed the best overall ‚Äî especially in recall, which is key for fraud detection.
