COMPUTER TOOLS promote ﬂexibility and meet ABET requirements
•PSpice is introduced in Chapter 3 and appears in special sections throughout the text. Appendix D serves
as a tutorial on PSpice for Windows for readers not familiar with its use. The special sections contain exam-
ples and practice problems using PSpice. Additional homework problems at the end of each chapter also
provide an opportunity to use PSpice.
•MATLAB®is introduced through a tutorial in Appendix E to show its usage in circuit analysis. A number
of examples and practice problems are presented throughout the book in a manner that will allow the studentto develop a facility with this powerful tool. A number of end-of-chapter problems will aid in understandinghow to effectively use MATLAB .
•KCIDE for Circuits is a working software environment developed at Cleveland State University. It is
designed to help the student work through circuit problems in an organized manner following the processon problem-solving discussed in Section 1.8. Appendix F contains a description of how to use the software.Additional examples can be found at the web site, http://kcide.fennresearch.or
g/. The actual software pack-
age can be downloaded for free from this site. One of the best beneﬁts from using this package is that itautomatically generates a Word document and/or a PowerPoint presentation.
CAREERS AND HISTORY of electrical engineering pioneers
Since a course in circuit analysis may be a student’s ﬁrst exposure to electrical engineering, each chapter openswith discussions about how to enhance skills that contribute to successful problem-solving or career-orientedtalks on a sub-discipline of electrical engineering. The chapter openers are intended to help students graspthe scope of electrical engineering and give thought to the various careers available to EE graduates. The open-ing boxes include information on careers in electronics, instrumentation, electromagnetics, control systems,engineering education, and the importance of good communication skills. Historicals throughout the textprovide brief biological sketches of such engineering pioneers as Faraday, Ampere, Edison, Henry, Fourier,Volta, and Bell.ale29559_IFC.qxd  07/11/2008  07:40 PM  Page 3

OUR COMMITMENT TO ACCURACY
You have a right to expect an accurate textbook, and McGraw-Hill Engineering invests
considerable time and effort to ensure that we deliver one. Listed below are the many
steps we take in this process.  
OUR ACCURACY VERIFICATION PROCESS
First Round
Step 1: Numerous college engineering instructors review the manuscript and report
errors to the editorial team. The authors review their comments and make the necessarycorrections in their manuscript.  
Second Round
Step 2: An expert in the field works through every example and exercise in the final
manuscript to verify the accuracy of the examples, exercises, and solutions. The authors
review any resulting corrections and incorporate them into the final manuscript and solu-tions manual.  
Step 3: The manuscript goes to a copyeditor, who reviews the pages for grammatical and
stylistic considerations. At the same time, the expert in the field begins a second accuracy
check. All corrections are submitted simultaneously to the authors, who review and inte-
grate the editing, and then submit the manuscript pages for typesetting.
Third Round
Step 4: The authors review their page proofs for a dual purpose: 1) to make certain that
any previous corrections were properly made, and 2) to look for any errors they might
have missed.
Step 5: A proofreader is assigned to the project to examine the new page proofs, double
check the authors' work, and add a fresh, critical eye to the book. Revisions are incorpo-
rated into a new batch of pages which the authors check again.
Fourth Round
Step 6: The author team submits the solutions manual to the expert in the field, who
checks text pages against the solutions manual as a final review.  Step 7: The project manager, editorial team, and author team review the pages for a
final accuracy check.
The resulting engineering textbook has gone through several layers of quality assurance
and is verified to be as accurate and error-free as possible. Our authors and publishingstaff are confident that through this process we deliver textbooks that are industry leadersin their correctness and technical integrity.ale29559_IFC.qxd  07/11/2008  07:40 PM  Page 4

Preface
You may be wondering why we chose a photo of astronauts working
in space on the Space Station for the cover. We actually chose it for
several reasons. Obviously, it is very exciting; in fact, space representsthe most exciting frontier for the entire world! In addition, much of thestation itself consists of all kinds of circuits! One of the most signiﬁ-cant circuits within the station is its power distribution system. It is acomplete and self contained, modern power generation and distributionsystem. That is why NASA (especially NASA-Glenn) continues to beat the forefront of both theoretical as well as applied power systemresearch and development. The technology that has gone into the devel-opment of space exploration continues to ﬁnd itself impacting terres-trial technology in many important ways. For some of you, this will bean important career path.
FEATURES
New to This Edition
Acourse in circuit analysis is perhaps the ﬁrst exposure students have
to electrical engineering. This is also a place where we can enhancesome of the skills that they will later need as they learn how to design.
In the fourth edition, we have included a very signiﬁcant new
feature to help students enhance skills that are an important part of thedesign process. We call this new feature, design a problem.
We know it is not possible to fully develop a student’s design skills
in a fundamental course like circuits. To fully develop design skills astudent needs a design experience normally reserved for their senioryear. This does not mean that some of those skills cannot be developedand exercised in a circuits course. The text already included open-ended questions that help students use creativity, which is an impor-tant part of learning how to design. We already have some questionsthat are open desired to add much more into our text in this importantarea and have developed an approach to do just that. When we developproblems for the student to solve our goal is that in solving the prob-lem the student learn more about the theory and the problem solvingprocess. Why not have the students design problems like we do? Thatis exactly what we will do in each chapter. Within the normal problemset, we have a set of problems where we ask the student to design aproblem. This will have two very important results. The ﬁrst will be abetter understanding of the basic theory and the second will be theenhancement of some of the student’s basic design skills.
We are making effective use of the principle of learning by teach-
ing. Essentially we all learn better when we teach a subject. Design-ing effective problems is a key part of the teaching process. Studentsale29559_fm.qxd  08/08/2008  10:16 AM  Page xiii

should also be encouraged to develop problems, when appropriate,
which have nice numbers and do not necessarily overemphasize com-plicated mathematical manipulations.
Additionally we have changed almost 40% of the Practice Prob-
lems with the idea to better reﬂect more real component values and tohelp the student better understand the problem and have added 121design a problem problems. We have also changed and added a total
of 357 end-of-chapter problems (this number contains the new design
a problem problems). This brings up a very important advantage to our
textbook, we have a total of 2404 Examples, Practice Problems,Review Questions, and end-of-chapter problems!
Retained from Previous Editions
The main objective of the fourth edition of this book remains the sameas the previous editions—to present circuit analysis in a manner that isclearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other circuit text,and to assist the student in beginning to see the “fun” in engineering.This objective is achieved in the following ways:
•Chapter Openers and SummariesEach chapter opens with a discussion about how to enhance skillswhich contribute to successful problem solving as well as suc-cessful careers or a career-oriented talk on a sub-discipline of elec-trical engineering. This is followed by an introduction that links thechapter with the previous chapters and states the chapter objectives.The chapter ends with a summary of key points and formulas.
•Problem Solving MethodologyChapter 1 introduces a six-step method for solving circuit problemswhich is used consistently throughout the book and media supple-ments to promote best-practice problem-solving procedures.
•Student Friendly Writing StyleAll principles are presented in a lucid, logical, step-by-step manner.As much as possible, we avoid wordiness and giving too muchdetail that could hide concepts and impede overall understanding ofthe material.
•Boxed Formulas and Key TermsImportant formulas are boxed as a means of helping students sortout what is essential from what is not. Also, to ensure that studentsclearly understand the key elements of the subject matter, keyterms are deﬁned and highlighted.
•Margin NotesMarginal notes are used as a pedagogical aid. They serve multipleuses such as hints, cross-references, more exposition, warnings,reminders not to make some particular common mistakes, andproblem-solving insights.
•Worked Examples
Thoroughly worked examples are liberally given at the end of everysection. The examples are regarded as a part of the text and areclearly explained without asking the reader to ﬁll in missing steps.Thoroughly worked examples give students a good understand-ing of the solution process and the conﬁdence to solve problemsale29559_fm.qxd  07/28/2008  11:54 AM  Page xiv
Preface xv
themselves. Some of the problems are solved in two or three dif-
ferent ways to facilitate a substantial comprehension of the subjectmaterial as well as a comparison of different approaches.
•Practice ProblemsTo give students practice opportunity, each illustrative example is
immediately followed by a practice problem with the answer. Thestudent can follow the example step by step to aid in the solutionof the practice problem without ﬂipping pages or looking at theend of the book for answers. The practice problem is also intendedto test a student’s understanding of the preceding example. It willreinforce their grasp of the material before the student can moveon to the next section. Complete solutions to the practice problemsare available to students on ARIS.
•Application SectionsThe last section in each chapter is devoted to practical applicationaspects of the concepts covered in the chapter. The material cov-ered in the chapter is applied to at least one or two practical prob-lems or devices. This helps students see how the concepts areapplied to real-life situations.
•Review QuestionsTenreview questions in the form of multiple-choice objective items
are provided at the end of each chapter with answers. The reviewquestions are intended to cover the little “tricks” that the examplesand end-of-chapter problems may not cover. They serve as a self-test device and help students determine how well they have mas-tered the chapter.
•Computer ToolsIn recognition of the requirements by ABET
®on integrating com-
puter tools, the use of PSpice, MATLAB, KCIDE for Circuits, and
developing design skills are encouraged in a student-friendly man-ner. PSpice is covered early on in the text so that students can

Organization
This book was written for a two-semester or three-quarter course inlinear circuit analysis. The book may also be used for a one-semestercourse by a proper selection of chapters and sections by the instructor.It is broadly divided into three parts.
•Part 1, consisting of Chapters 1 to 8, is devoted to dc circuits. Itcovers the fundamental laws and theorems, circuits techniques, andpassive and active elements.
•Part 2, which contains Chapter 9 to 14, deals with ac circuits. Itintroduces phasors, sinusoidal steady-state analysis, ac power, rmsvalues, three-phase systems, and frequency response.
•Part 3, consisting of Chapters 15 to 19, is devoted to advancedtechniques for network analysis. It provides students with a solidintroduction to the Laplace transform, Fourier series, Fourier trans-form, and two-port network analysis.
The material in three parts is more than sufﬁcient for a two-semestercourse, so the instructor must select which chapters or sections to cover.Sections marked with the dagger sign (†) may be skipped, explainedbrieﬂy, or assigned as homework. They can be omitted without loss ofxvi Prefaceale29559_fm.qxd  07/28/2008  11:54 AM  Page xvi

continuity. Each chapter has plenty of problems grouped according to
the sections of the related material and diverse enough that the instruc-tor can choose some as examples and assign some as homework. Asstated earlier, we are using three icons with this edition. We are using
to denote problems that either require PSpice in the solution process,
where the circuit complexity is such that PSpice would make the solu-
tion process easier, and where PSpice makes a good check to see if the
problem has been solved correctly. We are using to denote problemswhere MATLAB is required in the solution process, where MATLAB
makes sense because of the problem makeup and its complexity, andwhere MATLAB makes a good check to see if the problem has been
solved correctly. Finally, we use to identify problems that help thestudent develop skills that are needed for engineering design. More dif-ﬁcult problems are marked with an asterisk (*). Comprehensive prob-lems follow the end-of-chapter problems. They are mostly applicationsproblems that require skills learned from that particular chapter.
Prerequisites
As with most introductory circuit courses, the main prerequisites, fora course using the text, are physics and calculus. Although familiaritywith complex numbers is helpful in the later part of the book, it is notrequired. A very important asset of this text is that ALL the mathe-matical equations and fundamentals of physics needed by the student,are included in the text.

GUIDED TOUR
The main objective of this book is to present circuit analysis in a man-
ner that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than othertexts. For you, the student, here are some features to help you studyand be successful in this course.
The four color art program brings circuit draw-ings to life and enhances key concepts throughoutthe text.
1.5 Power and Energy 11
To relate power and energy to voltage and current, we recall from
physics that:
Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in
watts (W).
We write this relationship as
(1.5)
where pis power in watts (W), wis energy in joules (J), and tis time
in seconds (s). From Eqs. (1.1), (1.3), and (1.5), it follows that
(1.6)
or
(1.7)
The power p in Eq. (1.7) is a time-varying quantity and is called the
instantaneous power . Thus, the power absorbed or supplied by an ele-
ment is the product of the voltage across the element and the current
through it. If the power has a sign, power is being delivered to orabsorbed by the element. If, on the other hand, the power has a sign,power is being supplied by the element. But how do we know whenthe power has a negative or a positive sign?
Current direction and voltage polarity play a major role in deter-
mining the sign of power. It is therefore important that we pay atten-tion to the relationship between current i and voltage v in Fig. 1.8(a).
The voltage polarity and current direction must conform with thoseshown in Fig. 1.8(a) in order for the power to have a positive sign.This is known as the passive sign convention. By the passive sign con-
vention, current enters through the positive polarity of the voltage. Inthis case, or implies that the element is absorbingpower. However, if or , as in Fig. 1.8(b), the elementis releasing or supplying power.
Passive sign convention is satisﬁed when the current enters through
the positive terminal of an element and pv i . If the current enters
through the negative terminal, pv i .
Unless otherwise stated, we will follow the passive sign conven-
tion throughout this text. For example, the element in both circuits ofFig. 1.9 has an absorbing power of W because a positive currententers the positive terminal in both cases. In Fig. 1.10, however, theelement is supplying power of W because a positive current entersthe negative terminal. Of course, an absorbing power of W isequivalent to a supplying power of W. In general,

Although the problems to be solved during one’s career will vary in
complexity and magnitude, the basic principles to be followed remainthe same. The process outlined here is the one developed by theauthors over many years of problem solving with students, for thesolution of engineering problems in industry, and for problem solvingin research.
We will list the steps simply and then elaborate on them.
1. Carefully Deﬁne the problem.
2.Present everything you know about the problem.
3. Establish a set of Alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success.
4.Attempt a problem solution.
5.Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy.
6.Has the problem been solved Satisfactorily? If so, present thesolution; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through theprocess again.
1.Carefully Deﬁne the problem. This may be the most important part
of the process, because it becomes the foundation for all the rest of thesteps. In general, the presentation of engineering problems is somewhatincomplete. You must do all you can to make sure you understand theproblem as thoroughly as the presenter of the problem understands it.Time spent at this point clearly identifying the problem will save you
considerable time and frustration later. As a student, you can clarify aproblem statement in a textbook by asking your professor. A problempresented to you in industry may require that you consult several indi-viduals. At this step, it is important to develop questions that need tobe addressed before continuing the solution process. If you have suchquestions, you need to consult with the appropriate individuals orresources to obtain the answers to those questions. With those answers,you can now reﬁne the problem, and use that reﬁnement as the prob-lem statement for the rest of the solution process.
2.Present everything you know about the problem . You are now ready
to write down everything you know about the problem and its possiblesolutions. This important step will save you time and frustration later.
3.Establish a set of Alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success. Almost every problem willhave a number of possible paths that can lead to a solution. It is highlydesirable to identify as many of those paths as possible. At this point,you also need to determine what tools are available to you, such asPSpice and MATLAB and other software packages that can greatly
reduce effort and increase accuracy. Again, we want to stress that timespent carefully deﬁning the problem and investigating alternativeapproaches to its solution will pay big dividends later. Evaluating thealternatives and determining which promises the greatest likelihood ofsuccess may be difﬁcult but will be well worth the effort. Documentthis process well since you will want to come back to it if the ﬁrstapproach does not work.
4.Attempt a problem solution . Now is the time to actually begin
solving the problem. The process you follow must be well documented1.820 Chapter 1 Basic Concepts
in order to present a detailed solution if successful, and to evaluate theprocess if you are not successful. This detailed evaluation may lead tocorrections that can then lead to a successful solution. It can also leadto new alternatives to try. Many times, it is wise to fully set up a solu-tion before putting numbers into equations. This will help in checkingyour results.
5.Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy . You now thoroughly
evaluate what you have accomplished. Decide if you have an acceptablesolution, one that you want to present to your team, boss, or professor.
6.Has the problem been solved Satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the processagain. Now you need to present your solution or try another alterna-
tive. At this point, presenting your solution may bring closure to theprocess. Often, however, presentation of a solution leads to furtherreﬁnement of the problem deﬁnition, and the process continues. Fol-lowing this process will eventually lead to a satisfactory conclusion.
Now let us look at this process for a student taking an electrical
and computer engineering foundations course. (The basic process alsoapplies to almost every engineering course.) Keep in mind thatalthough the steps have been simpliﬁed to apply to academic types ofproblems, the process as stated always needs to be followed. We con-
sider a simple example.1.8 Problem Solving 21
Figure 1.19
Illustrative example.Example 1.10 Solve for the current ﬂowing through the resistor in Fig. 1.19.
Solution:
1.Carefully Deﬁne the problem. This is only a simple example, but
we can already see that we do not know the polarity on the 3-V source.
We have the following options. We can ask the professor what the
polarity should be. If we cannot ask, then we need to make a decisionon what to do next. If we have time to work the problem both ways,we can solve for the current when the 3-V source is plus on top andthen plus on the bottom. If we do not have the time to work it bothways, assume a polarity and then carefully document your decision.Let us assume that the professor tells us that the source is plus on thebottom as shown in Fig. 1.20.
2.Present everything you know about the problem . Presenting all that
we know about the problem involves labeling the circuit clearly so thatwe deﬁne what we seek.
Given the circuit shown in Fig. 1.20, solve for .We now check with the professor, if reasonable, to see if the prob-
lem is properly deﬁned.
3.Establish a set of Alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success . There are essentially three
techniques that can be used to solve this problem. Later in the text youwill see that you can use circuit analysis (using Kirchhoff’s laws andOhm’s law), nodal analysis, and mesh analysis.
To solve for using circuit analysis will eventually lead to a
solution, but it will likely take more work than either nodal or meshi

Therefore, we will solve for using nodal analysis.
4.Attempt a problem solution . We ﬁrst write down all of the equa-
tions we will need in order to ﬁnd .
Now we can solve for

Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) to check the results.

Summary
1.An electric circuit consists of electrical elements connected
together.
2. The International System of Units (SI) is the international mea-
surement language, which enables engineers to communicate theirresults. From the six principal units, the units of other physicalquantities can be derived.
3. Current is the rate of charge ﬂow.
4. V oltage is the energy required to move 1 C of charge through an
element.
5. Power is the energy supplied or absorbed per unit time. It is also
the product of voltage and current.
6. According to the passive sign convention, power assumes a posi-
tive sign when the current enters the positive polarity of the voltage
across an element.
7. An ideal voltage source produces a speciﬁc potential difference
across its terminals regardless of what is connected to it. An idealcurrent source produces a speciﬁc current through its terminalsregardless of what is connected to it.
8. V oltage and current sources can be dependent or independent. A
dependent source is one whose value depends on some other cir-cuit variable.

Most of us deal with electronic products on a routine basis and havesome experience with personal computers. A basic component forthe integrated circuits found in these electronics and computers is theactive, three-terminal device known as the transistor. Understanding
the transistor is essential before an engineer can start an electronic cir-cuit design.
Figure 3.37 depicts various kinds of transistors commercially avail-
able. There are two basic types of transistors: bipolar junction transis-tors (BJTs) and ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we consider only
the BJTs, which were the ﬁrst of the two and are still used today. Ourobjective is to present enough detail about the BJT to enable us to applythe techniques developed in this chapter to analyze dc transistor circuits.p3.9

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.d), “an ability to function on
multi-disciplinary teams.”
The “ability to function on multidisciplinary teams” is inherently crit-ical for the working engineer. Engineers rarely, if ever, work by them-selves. Engineers will always be part of some team. One of the thingsI like to remind students is that you do not have to like everyone on ateam; you just have to be a successful part of that team.
Most frequently, these teams include individuals from of a variety
of engineering disciplines, as well as individuals from nonengineeringdisciplines such as marketing and ﬁnance.
Students can easily develop and enhance this skill by working in
study groups in every course they take. Clearly, working in studygroups in nonengineering courses as well as engineering courses out-side your discipline will also give you experience with multidiscipli-nary teams.

A Note to the Student
This may be your ﬁrst course in electrical engineering. Although elec-
trical engineering is an exciting and challenging discipline, the coursemay intimidate you. This book was written to prevent that. A good text-book and a good professor are an advantage—but you are the one whodoes the learning. If you keep the following ideas in mind, you will dovery well in this course.
•This course is the foundation on which most other courses in theelectrical engineering curriculum rest. For this reason, put in asmuch effort as you can. Study the course regularly.
•Problem solving is an essential part of the learning process. Solve asmany problems as you can. Begin by solving the practice problemfollowing each example, and then proceed to the end-of-chapterproblems. The best way to learn is to solve a lot of problems. Anasterisk in front of a problem indicates a challenging problem.
•Spice, a computer circuit analysis program, is used throughout thetextbook. PSpice, the personal computer version of Spice, is the
popular standard circuit analysis program at most universities.PSpice for Windows is described in Appendix D. Make an effort
to learn PSpice, because you can check any circuit problem withPSpice and be sure you are handing in a correct problem solution.
•MATLAB is another software that is very useful in circuit analysis
and other courses you will be taking. A brief tutorial on MATLAB
is given in Appendix E to get you started. The best way to learnMATLAB is to start working with it once you know a few commands.
•Each chapter ends with a section on how the material covered inthe chapter can be applied to real-life situations. The concepts inthis section may be new and advanced to you. No doubt, you willlearn more of the details in other courses. We are mainly interestedin gaining a general familiarity with these ideas.
•Attempt the review questions at the end of each chapter. Theywill help you discover some “tricks” not revealed in class or in thetextbook.
•Clearly a lot of effort has gone into making the technical details inthis book easy to understand. It also contains all the mathematicsand physics necessary to understand the theory and will be veryuseful in your other engineering courses. However, we have alsofocused on creating a reference for you to use both in school aswell as when working in industry or seeking a graduate degree.
•It is very tempting to sell your book after you have completed yourclassroom experience; however, our advice to you is DO NOT SELLYOUR ENGINEERING BOOKS! Books have always been expen-
sive, however, the cost of this book is virtually the same as I paidfor my circuits text back in the early 60s in terms of real dollars.In fact, it is actually cheaper. In addition, engineering books ofthe past are no where near as complete as what is available now.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.a), “an ability to apply knowledge
of mathematics, science, and engineering.”
As students, you are required to study mathematics, science, and engi-neering with the purpose of being able to apply that knowledge to thesolution of engineering problems. The skill here is the ability to applythe fundamentals of these areas in the solution of a problem. So, howdo you develop and enhance this skill?
The best approach is to work as many problems as possible in all
of your courses. However, if you are really going to be successful withthis, you must spend time analyzing where and when and why you havedifﬁculty in easily arriving at successful solutions. You may be sur-prised to learn that most of your problem-solving problems are withmathematics rather than your understanding of theory. You may alsolearn that you start working the problem too soon. Taking time to thinkabout the problem and how you should solve it will always save youtime and frustration in the end.
What I have found that works best for me is to apply our six-
step problem-solving technique. Then I carefully identify the areaswhere I have difﬁculty solving the problem. Many times, my actualdeﬁciencies are in my understanding and ability to use correctly cer-tain mathematical principles. I then return to my fundamental mathtexts and carefully review the appropriate sections and in some caseswork some example problems in that text. This brings me to anotherimportant thing you should always do: Keep nearby all your basicmathematics, science, and engineering textbooks.
This process of continually looking up material you thought you
had acquired in earlier courses may seem very tedious at ﬁrst; how-ever, as your skills develop and your knowledge increases, this processwill become easier and easier. On a personal note, it is this very processthat led me from being a much less than average student to someonewho could earn a Ph.D. and become a successful researcher.

Introduction
Electric circuit theory and electromagnetic theory are the two funda-
mental theories upon which all branches of electrical engineering arebuilt. Many branches of electrical engineering, such as power, electricmachines, control, electronics, communications, and instrumentation,are based on electric circuit theory. Therefore, the basic electric circuittheory course is the most important course for an electrical engineer-ing student, and always an excellent starting point for a beginning stu-dent in electrical engineering education. Circuit theory is also valuableto students specializing in other branches of the physical sciencesbecause circuits are a good model for the study of energy systems ingeneral, and because of the applied mathematics, physics, and topol-ogy involved.
In electrical engineering, we are often interested in communicating
or transferring energy from one point to another. To do this requires aninterconnection of electrical devices. Such interconnection is referredto as an electric circuit , and each component of the circuit is known as
an element.
An electric circuit is an interconnection of electrical elements.
Asimple electric circuit is shown in Fig. 1.1. It consists of three
basic elements: a battery, a lamp, and connecting wires. Such a simplecircuit can exist by itself; it has several applications, such as a ﬂash-light, a search light, and so forth.
Acomplicated real circuit is displayed in Fig. 1.2, representing the
schematic diagram for a radio receiver. Although it seems complicated,this circuit can be analyzed using the techniques we cover in this book.Our goal in this text is to learn various analytical techniques andcomputer software applications for describing the behavior of a circuitlike this.
Electric circuits are used in numerous electrical systems to accom-
plish different tasks. Our objective in this book is not the study ofvarious uses and applications of circuits. Rather our major concern isthe analysis of the circuits. By the analysis of a circuit, we mean astudy of the behavior of the circuit: How does it respond to a giveninput? How do the interconnected elements and devices in the circuitinteract?
We commence our study by deﬁning some basic concepts. These
concepts include charge, current, voltage, circuit elements, power, andenergy. Before deﬁning these concepts, we must ﬁrst establish a sys-tem of units that we will use throughout the text.
Systems of Units
As electrical engineers, we deal with measurable quantities. Our mea-surement, however, must be communicated in a standard language thatvirtually all professionals can understand, irrespective of the countrywhere the measurement is conducted. Such an international measurement1.21.14 Chapter 1 Basic Concepts

language is the International System of Units (SI), adopted by the
General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. In this system,there are six principal units from which the units of all other physicalquantities can be derived. Table 1.1 shows the six units, their symbols,and the physical quantities they represent. The SI units are usedthroughout this text.
One great advantage of the SI unit is that it uses preﬁxes based on
the power of 10 to relate larger and smaller units to the basic unit.Table 1.2 shows the SI preﬁxes and their symbols. For example, the
following are expressions of the same distance in meters (m):

Charge and Current
The concept of electric charge is the underlying principle for explain-
ing all electrical phenomena. Also, the most basic quantity in an elec-tric circuit is the electric charge. We all experience the effect of electric
charge when we try to remove our wool sweater and have it stick toour body or walk across a carpet and receive a shock.
Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which mat-
ter consists, measured in coulombs (C).
We know from elementary physics that all matter is made of funda-
mental building blocks known as atoms and that each atom consists ofelectrons, protons, and neutrons. We also know that the charge eon an
electron is negative and equal in magnitude to C, whilea proton carries a positive charge of the same magnitude as the elec-tron. The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons leaves anatom neutrally charged.
The following points should be noted about electric charge:
1. The coulomb is a large unit for charges. In 1 C of charge, there
are electrons. Thus realistic orlaboratory values of charges are on the order of pC, nC, or C.
1
2.According to experimental observations, the only charges thatoccur in nature are integral multiples of the electronic charge
3. The law of conservation of charge states that charge can neither
be created nor destroyed, only transferred. Thus the algebraic sumof the electric charges in a system does not change.
We now consider the ﬂow of electric charges. A unique feature of
electric charge or electricity is the fact that it is mobile; that is, it can
be transferred from one place to another, where it can be converted toanother form of energy.
When a conducting wire (consisting of several atoms) is con-
nected to a battery (a source of electromotive force), the charges arecompelled to move; positive charges move in one direction while neg-ative charges move in the opposite direction. This motion of chargescreates electric current. It is conventional to take the current ﬂow asthe movement of positive charges. That is, opposite to the ﬂow of neg-ative charges, as Fig. 1.3 illustrates. This convention was introducedby Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), the American scientist and inven-tor. Although we now know that current in metallic conductors is dueto negatively charged electrons, we will follow the universallyaccepted convention that current is the net ﬂow of positive charges.Thus,
Electric current is the time rate of change of charge, measured in
amperes (A).e/H11005/H11002 1.602 /H1100310/H1100219 C.m1/H20862(1.602 /H1100310/H1100219)/H110056.24 /H1100310181.602 /H1100310/H11002191.36 Chapter 1 Basic Concepts

A convention is a standard way of
describing something so that others inthe profession can understand whatwe mean. We will be using IEEE con-ventions throughout this book.ale29559_ch01.qxd  07/08/2008  10:38 AM  Page 6

Mathematically, the relationship between current i , charge q , and time t is
(1.1)
where current is measured in amperes (A), and
The charge transferred between time and t is obtained by integrat-
ing both sides of Eq. (1.1). We obtain
(1.2)
The way we deﬁne current as iin Eq. (1.1) suggests that current need
not be a constant-valued function. As many of the examples and prob-
lems in this chapter and subsequent chapters suggest, there can be sev-eral types of current; that is, charge can vary with time in several ways.
If the current does not change with time, but remains constant, we
call it a direct current (dc).
A direct current (dc) is a current that remains constant with time.
By convention the symbol Iis used to represent such a constant current.
Atime-varying current is represented by the symbol i. A common
form of time-varying current is the sinusoidal current or alternatingcurrent (ac).
An alternating current (ac) is a current that varies sinusoidally with time.
Such current is used in your household, to run the air conditioner,refrigerator, washing machine, and other electric appliances. Figure 1.4Q/H11005¢/H20910t

Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836), a French mathematician and
physicist, laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He deﬁned the elec-
tric current and developed a way to measure it in the 1820s.
Born in Lyons, France, Ampere at age 12 mastered Latin in a few
weeks, as he was intensely interested in mathematics and many of thebest mathematical works were in Latin. He was a brilliant scientist anda proliﬁc writer. He formulated the laws of electromagnetics. He in-vented the electromagnet and the ammeter. The unit of electric current,the ampere, was named after him.Historical

shows direct current and alternating current; these are the two most
common types of current. We will consider other types later in thebook.
Once we deﬁne current as the movement of charge, we expect cur-
rent to have an associated direction of ﬂow. As mentioned earlier, thedirection of current ﬂow is conventionally taken as the direction of pos-itive charge movement. Based on this convention, a current of 5 A maybe represented positively or negatively as shown in Fig. 1.5. In otherwords, a negative current of A ﬂowing in one direction as shownin Fig. 1.5(b) is the same as a current of A ﬂowing in the oppositedirection./H110015/H1100258 Chapter 1 Basic Concepts

Voltage
As explained brieﬂy in the previous section, to move the electron in a
conductor in a particular direction requires some work or energy trans-fer. This work is performed by an external electromotive force (emf),typically represented by the battery in Fig. 1.3. This emf is also knownas voltage or potential difference. The voltage between two points

Historical
Alessandro Antonio Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist,
invented the electric battery—which provided the ﬁrst continuous ﬂow
of electricity—and the capacitor.
Born into a noble family in Como, Italy, V olta was performing
electrical experiments at age 18. His invention of the battery in 1796revolutionized the use of electricity. The publication of his work in1800 marked the beginning of electric circuit theory. V olta receivedmany honors during his lifetime. The unit of voltage or potential dif-ference, the volt, was named in his honor.
volts higher than point b, or (2) the potential at point awith respect to
point bis . It follows logically that in general
(1.4)
For example, in Fig. 1.7, we have two representations of the same volt-age. In Fig. 1.7(a), point ais V above point b; in Fig. 1.7(b), point b
is V above point a. We may say that in Fig. 1.7(a), there is a 9-V
voltage drop from ato bor equivalently a 9-V voltage rise from bto
a. In other words, a voltage drop from ato bis equivalent to a volt-
age rise from bto a.
Current and voltage are the two basic variables in electric circuits.
The common term signal is used for an electric quantity such as a cur-
rent or a voltage (or even electromagnetic wave) when it is used forconveying information. Engineers prefer to call such variables signalsrather than mathematical functions of time because of their importancein communications and other disciplines. Like electric current, a con-stant voltage is called a dc voltage and is represented by V , whereas a
sinusoidally time-varying voltage is called an ac voltage and is repre-
sented by v. A dc voltage is commonly produced by a battery; ac volt-
age is produced by an electric generator.
Power and Energy
Although current and voltage are the two basic variables in an electriccircuit, they are not sufﬁcient by themselves. For practical purposes,we need to know how much power an electric device can handle. We
all know from experience that a 100-watt bulb gives more light than a60-watt bulb. We also know that when we pay our bills to the electricutility companies, we are paying for the electric energy consumed over
a certain period of time. Thus, power and energy calculations areimportant in circuit analysis.1.5/H110029/H110019vab/H11005/H11002vbavab10 Chapter 1 Basic Concepts

1.5 Power and Energy 11
To relate power and energy to voltage and current, we recall from
physics that:
Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in
watts (W).
We write this relationship as
(1.5)
where pis power in watts (W), w is energy in joules (J), and tis time
in seconds (s). From Eqs. (1.1), (1.3), and (1.5), it follows that
(1.6)
or
(1.7)
The power p in Eq. (1.7) is a time-varying quantity and is called the
instantaneous power . Thus, the power absorbed or supplied by an ele-
ment is the product of the voltage across the element and the current
through it. If the power has a sign, power is being delivered to orabsorbed by the element. If, on the other hand, the power has a sign,power is being supplied by the element. But how do we know whenthe power has a negative or a positive sign?
Current direction and voltage polarity play a major role in deter-
mining the sign of power. It is therefore important that we pay atten-tion to the relationship between current iand voltage v in Fig. 1.8(a).
The voltage polarity and current direction must conform with thoseshown in Fig. 1.8(a) in order for the power to have a positive sign.This is known as the passive sign convention. By the passive sign con-
vention, current enters through the positive polarity of the voltage. Inthis case, or implies that the element is absorbingpower. However, if or , as in Fig. 1.8(b), the elementis releasing or supplying power.
Passive sign convention is satisﬁed when the current enters through
the positive terminal of an element and pv i . If the current enters
through the negative terminal, pv i .
Unless otherwise stated, we will follow the passive sign conven-
tion throughout this text. For example, the element in both circuits ofFig. 1.9 has an absorbing power of W because a positive currententers the positive terminal in both cases. In Fig. 1.10, however, theelement is supplying power of W because a positive current entersthe negative terminal. Of course, an absorbing power of W isequivalent to a supplying power of W. In general,

In fact, the law of conservation of energy must be obeyed in any
electric circuit. For this reason, the algebraic sum of power in a cir-
cuit, at any instant of time, must be zero:
(1.8)
This again conﬁrms the fact that the total power supplied to the circuitmust balance the total power absorbed.
From Eq. (1.6), the energy absorbed or supplied by an element
from time to time t is
(1.9)
Energy is the capacity to do work, measured in joules (J).

1884 Exhibition In the United States, nothing promoted the future
of electricity like the 1884 International Electrical Exhibition. Just
imagine a world without electricity, a world illuminated by candles andgaslights, a world where the most common transportation was by walk-ing and riding on horseback or by horse-drawn carriage. Into this worldan exhibition was created that highlighted Thomas Edison and reﬂectedhis highly developed ability to promote his inventions and products.His exhibit featured spectacular lighting displays powered by an impres-sive 100-kW “Jumbo” generator.
Edward Weston’s dynamos and lamps were featured in the United
States Electric Lighting Company’s display. Weston’s well known col-lection of scientiﬁc instruments was also shown.
Other prominent exhibitors included Frank Sprague, Elihu Thompson,
and the Brush Electric Company of Cleveland. The American Instituteof Electrical Engineers (AIEE) held its ﬁrst technical meeting on Octo-ber 7–8 at the Franklin Institute during the exhibit. AIEE merged withthe Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) in 1964 to form the Institute ofElectrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).ale29559_ch01.qxd  07/08/2008  10:38 AM  Page 14

Circuit Elements
As we discussed in Section 1.1, an element is the basic building block
of a circuit. An electric circuit is simply an interconnection of the ele-ments. Circuit analysis is the process of determining voltages across(or the currents through) the elements of the circuit.
There are two types of elements found in electric circuits: pas-
sive elements and active elements. An active element is capable of
generating energy while a passive element is not. Examples of pas-sive elements are resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Typical activeelements include generators, batteries, and operational ampliﬁers. Ouraim in this section is to gain familiarity with some important activeelements.
The most important active elements are voltage or current
sources that generally deliver power to the circuit connected tothem. There are two kinds of sources: independent and dependentsources.
An ideal independent source is an active element that provides a
speciﬁed voltage or current that is completely independent of other
circuit elements.
In other words, an ideal independent voltage source delivers to the
circuit whatever current is necessary to maintain its terminal volt-age. Physical sources such as batteries and generators may beregarded as approximations to ideal voltage sources. Figure 1.11shows the symbols for independent voltage sources. Notice that bothsymbols in Fig. 1.11(a) and (b) can be used to represent a dc volt-age source, but only the symbol in Fig. 1.11(a) can be used for atime-varying voltage source. Similarly, an ideal independent currentsource is an active element that provides a speciﬁed current com-pletely independent of the voltage across the source. That is, the cur-rent source delivers to the circuit whatever voltage is necessary tomaintain the designated current. The symbol for an independent cur-rent source is displayed in Fig. 1.12, where the arrow indicates thedirection of current i .
An ideal dependent (or controlled) source is an active element in
which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.
Dependent sources are usually designated by diamond-shaped symbols,as shown in Fig. 1.13. Since the control of the dependent source isachieved by a voltage or current of some other element in the circuit,and the source can be voltage or current, it follows that there are fourpossible types of dependent sources, namely:
1. A voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).2. A current-controlled voltage source (CCVS).3. A voltage-controlled current source (VCCS).4. A current-controlled current source (CCCS).1.61.6 Circuit Elements 15

Dependent sources are useful in modeling elements such as transis-
tors, operational ampliﬁers, and integrated circuits. An example of acurrent-controlled voltage source is shown on the right-hand side ofFig. 1.14, where the voltage of the voltage source depends onthe current i through element C . Students might be surprised that
the value of the dependent voltage source is V (and not A)because it is a voltage source. The key idea to keep in mind isthat a voltage source comes with polarities in its symbol,while a current source comes with an arrow, irrespective of what itdepends on.
It should be noted that an ideal voltage source (dependent or inde-
pendent) will produce any current required to ensure that the terminalvoltage is as stated, whereas an ideal current source will produce thenecessary voltage to ensure the stated current ﬂow. Thus, an idealsource could in theory supply an inﬁnite amount of energy. It shouldalso be noted that not only do sources supply power to a circuit, theycan absorb power from a circuit too. For a voltage source, we knowthe voltage but not the current supplied or drawn by it. By the sametoken, we know the current supplied by a current source but not thevoltage across it.(/H11001 /H11002)10i 10i10i

Calculate the power supplied or absorbed by each element in Fig. 1.15.
Solution:
We apply the sign convention for power shown in Figs. 1.8 and 1.9.
For , the 5-A current is out of the positive terminal (or into thenegative terminal); hence,
For and , the current ﬂows into the positive terminal of the ele-
ment in each case.
For , we should note that the voltage is 8 V (positive at the top), the
same as the voltage for since both the passive element and thedependent source are connected to the same terminals. (Remember thatvoltage is always measured across an element in a circuit.) Since thecurrent ﬂows out of the positive terminal,
We should observe that the 20-V independent voltage source and 
dependent current source are supplying power to the rest of
the network, while the two passive elements are absorbing power.
Also,
In agreement with Eq. (1.8), the total power supplied equals the total
power absorbed.p

Applications2
In this section, we will consider two practical applications of the
concepts developed in this chapter. The ﬁrst one deals with the TVpicture tube and the other with how electric utilities determine yourelectric bill.
1.7.1 TV Picture Tube
One important application of the motion of electrons is found in boththe transmission and reception of TV signals. At the transmission end,a TV camera reduces a scene from an optical image to an electricalsignal. Scanning is accomplished with a thin beam of electrons in aniconoscope camera tube.
At the receiving end, the image is reconstructed by using a cathode-
ray tube (CRT) located in the TV receiver.
3 The CRT is depicted in
Fig. 1.17. Unlike the iconoscope tube, which produces an electronbeam of constant intensity, the CRT beam varies in intensity accord-ing to the incoming signal. The electron gun, maintained at a highpotential, ﬁres the electron beam. The beam passes through two setsof plates for vertical and horizontal deﬂections so that the spot on thescreen where the beam strikes can move right and left and up anddown. When the electron beam strikes the ﬂuorescent screen, it givesoff light at that spot. Thus, the beam can be made to “paint” a pictureon the TV screen.1.71.7 Applications 17

basis for the picture tube used for so many years for televisions. It isstill the most economical device today, although the price of ﬂat-screensystems is rapidly becoming competitive. Before the Braun tube couldbe used in television, it took the inventiveness of Vladimir K.

television would become a reality. The iconoscope developed into theorthicon and the image orthicon, which allowed images to be capturedand converted into signals that could be sent to the television receiver.Thus, the television camera was born.

1.7.2 Electricity Bills
The second application deals with how an electric utility company charges
their customers. The cost of electricity depends upon the amount ofenergy consumed in kilowatt-hours (kWh). (Other factors that affect thecost include demand and power factors; we will ignore these for now.)However, even if a consumer uses no energy at all, there is a minimumservice charge the customer must pay because it costs money to stay con-nected to the power line. As energy consumption increases, the cost perkWh drops. It is interesting to note the average monthly consumption ofhousehold appliances for a family of ﬁve, shown in Table 1.3.1.7 Applications 19
Example 1.9 Ahomeowner consumes 700 kWh in January. Determine the electric-
ity bill for the month using the following residential rate schedule:
Base monthly charge of $12.00.
First 100 kWh per month at 16 cents/kWh.Next 200 kWh per month at 10 cents/kWh.Over 300 kWh per month at 6 cents/kWh.
Solution:
We calculate the electricity bill as follows.
Average cost /H11005$72
100/H11001200/H11001400/H1100510.2 cents/kWhBase monthly charge /H11005$12.00
First 100 kWh @ $0.16/k  Wh/H11005$16.00
Next 200 kWh @ $0.10/k  Wh/H11005$20.00
Remaining 400 kWh @ $0.06/k  Wh/H11005$24.00
Total charge /H11005$72.00
Practice Problem 1.9 Referring to the residential rate schedule in Example 1.9, calculate the
average cost per kWh if only 400 kWh are consumed in July when thefamily is on vacation most of the time.
Answer: 13.5 cents/kWh.

Problem Solving
Although the problems to be solved during one’s career will vary in
complexity and magnitude, the basic principles to be followed remainthe same. The process outlined here is the one developed by theauthors over many years of problem solving with students, for thesolution of engineering problems in industry, and for problem solvingin research.
We will list the steps simply and then elaborate on them.
1. Carefully deﬁne the problem.
2.Present everything you know about the problem.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success.
4.Attempt a problem solution.
5.Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily ? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the processagain.
1.Carefully deﬁne the problem. This may be the most important part
of the process, because it becomes the foundation for all the rest of thesteps. In general, the presentation of engineering problems is somewhatincomplete. You must do all you can to make sure you understand theproblem as thoroughly as the presenter of the problem understands it.Time spent at this point clearly identifying the problem will save you
considerable time and frustration later. As a student, you can clarify aproblem statement in a textbook by asking your professor. A problempresented to you in industry may require that you consult several indi-viduals. At this step, it is important to develop questions that need tobe addressed before continuing the solution process. If you have suchquestions, you need to consult with the appropriate individuals orresources to obtain the answers to those questions. With those answers,you can now reﬁne the problem, and use that reﬁnement as the prob-lem statement for the rest of the solution process.
2.Present everything you know about the problem . You are now ready
to write down everything you know about the problem and its possiblesolutions. This important step will save you time and frustration later.
3.Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success . Almost every problem will
have a number of possible paths that can lead to a solution. It is highlydesirable to identify as many of those paths as possible. At this point,you also need to determine what tools are available to you, such asPSpice and MATLAB and other software packages that can greatly
reduce effort and increase accuracy. Again, we want to stress that timespent carefully deﬁning the problem and investigating alternativeapproaches to its solution will pay big dividends later. Evaluating thealternatives and determining which promises the greatest likelihood ofsuccess may be difﬁcult but will be well worth the effort. Documentthis process well since you will want to come back to it if the ﬁrstapproach does not work.
4.Attempt a problem solution . Now is the time to actually begin
solving the problem. The process you follow must be well documented1.820 Chapter 1 Basic Conceptsale29559_ch01.qxd  07/08/2008  10:38 AM  Page 20

in order to present a detailed solution if successful, and to evaluate the
process if you are not successful. This detailed evaluation may lead tocorrections that can then lead to a successful solution. It can also leadto new alternatives to try. Many times, it is wise to fully set up a solu-tion before putting numbers into equations. This will help in checkingyour results.
5.Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy . You now thoroughly
evaluate what you have accomplished. Decide if you have an acceptablesolution, one that you want to present to your team, boss, or professor.
6.Has the problem been solved satisfactorily ? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the processagain. Now you need to present your solution or try another alterna-
tive. At this point, presenting your solution may bring closure to theprocess. Often, however, presentation of a solution leads to furtherreﬁnement of the problem deﬁnition, and the process continues. Fol-lowing this process will eventually lead to a satisfactory conclusion.
Now let us look at this process for a student taking an electrical
and computer engineering foundations course. (The basic process alsoapplies to almost every engineering course.) Keep in mind thatalthough the steps have been simpliﬁed to apply to academic types ofproblems, the process as stated always needs to be followed. We con-
sider a simple example.1.8 Problem Solving 21
Figure 1.19
Illustrative example.Example 1.10 Solve for the current ﬂowing through the resistor in Fig. 1.19.
Solution:
1.Carefully deﬁne the problem . This is only a simple example, but
we can already see that we do not know the polarity on the 3-V source.
We have the following options. We can ask the professor what the
polarity should be. If we cannot ask, then we need to make a decisionon what to do next. If we have time to work the problem both ways,we can solve for the current when the 3-V source is plus on top andthen plus on the bottom. If we do not have the time to work it bothways, assume a polarity and then carefully document your decision.Let us assume that the professor tells us that the source is plus on thebottom as shown in Fig. 1.20.
2.Present everything you know about the problem . Presenting all that
we know about the problem involves labeling the circuit clearly so thatwe deﬁne what we seek.
Given the circuit shown in Fig. 1.20, solve for .We now check with the professor, if reasonable, to see if the prob-
lem is properly deﬁned.
3.Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success . There are essentially three
techniques that can be used to solve this problem. Later in the text youwill see that you can use circuit analysis (using Kirchhoff’s laws andOhm’s law), nodal analysis, and mesh analysis.
To solve for using circuit analysis will eventually lead to a
solution, but it will likely take more work than either nodal or meshi

two simultaneous equations to ﬁnd the two loop currents indicated inFig. 1.21. Using nodal analysis requires solving for only one unknown.This is the easiest approach.i

Now we can solve for

of our answer.

Summary
1.An electric circuit consists of electrical elements connected
together.
2. The International System of Units (SI) is the international mea-
surement language, which enables engineers to communicate theirresults. From the six principal units, the units of other physicalquantities can be derived.
3. Current is the rate of charge ﬂow.
4. V oltage is the energy required to move 1 C of charge through an
element.
5. Power is the energy supplied or absorbed per unit time. It is also
the product of voltage and current.
6. According to the passive sign convention, power assumes a posi-
tive sign when the current enters the positive polarity of the voltage
across an element.
7. An ideal voltage source produces a speciﬁc potential difference
across its terminals regardless of what is connected to it. An idealcurrent source produces a speciﬁc current through its terminalsregardless of what is connected to it.
8. V oltage and current sources can be dependent or independent. A
dependent source is one whose value depends on some other cir-cuit variable.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.b), “an ability to design and con-
duct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data.
Engineers must be able to design and conduct experiments, as well asanalyze and interpret data. Most students have spent many hours per-forming experiments in high school and in college. During this time,you have been asked to analyze the data and to interpret the data.Therefore, you should already be skilled in these two activities. Myrecommendation is that, in the process of performing experiments inthe future, you spend more time in analyzing and interpreting the datain the context of the experiment. What does this mean?
If you are looking at a plot of voltage versus resistance or current
versus resistance or power versus resistance, what do you actually see?Does the curve make sense? Does it agree with what the theory tellsyou? Does it differ from expectation, and, if so, why? Clearly, practicewith analyzing and interpreting data will enhance this skill.
Since most, if not all, the experiments you are required to do as a
student involve little or no practice in designing the experiment, howcan you develop and enhance this skill?
Actually, developing this skill under this constraint is not as difﬁ-
cult as it seems. What you need to do is to take the experiment andanalyze it. Just break it down into its simplest parts, reconstruct it try-ing to understand why each element is there, and ﬁnally, determinewhat the author of the experiment is trying to teach you. Even thoughit may not always seem so, every experiment you do was designed bysomeone who was sincerely motivated to teach you something.

Introduction
Chapter 1 introduced basic concepts such as current, voltage, and
power in an electric circuit. To actually determine the values of thesevariables in a given circuit requires that we understand some funda-mental laws that govern electric circuits. These laws, known as Ohm’slaw and Kirchhoff’s laws, form the foundation upon which electric cir-cuit analysis is built.
In this chapter, in addition to these laws, we shall discuss some
techniques commonly applied in circuit design and analysis. These tech-niques include combining resistors in series or parallel, voltage division,current division, and delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta transformations. Theapplication of these laws and techniques will be restricted to resistivecircuits in this chapter. We will ﬁnally apply the laws and techniques toreal-life problems of electrical lighting and the design of dc meters.
Ohm’s Law
Materials in general have a characteristic behavior of resisting the ﬂowof electric charge. This physical property, or ability to resist current, isknown as resistance and is represented by the symbol R. The resist-
ance of any material with a uniform cross-sectional area A depends on
Aand its length , as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). We can represent resistance
(as measured in the laboratory), in mathematical form,

where is known as the resistivity of the material in ohm-meters. Good
conductors, such as copper and aluminum, have low resistivities, whileinsulators, such as mica and paper, have high resistivities. Table 2.1presents the values of for some common materials and shows whichmaterials are used for conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.
The circuit element used to model the current-resisting behavior of a
material is the resistor. For the purpose of constructing circuits, resistors
are usually made from metallic alloys and carbon compounds. The circuitrrR/H11005r

symbol for the resistor is shown in Fig. 2.1(b), where Rstands for the
resistance of the resistor. The resistor is the simplest passive element.
Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854), a German physicist, is credited
with ﬁnding the relationship between current and voltage for a resis-
tor. This relationship is known as Ohm’ s law.
Ohm’s law states that the voltage vacross a resistor is directly propor-
tional to the current iﬂowing through the resistor.
That is,
(2.2)
Ohm deﬁned the constant of proportionality for a resistor to be theresistance, R. (The resistance is a material property which can change
if the internal or external conditions of the element are altered, e.g., ifthere are changes in the temperature.) Thus, Eq. (2.2) becomes
(2.3)
which is the mathematical form of Ohm’s law. Rin Eq. (2.3) is mea-
sured in the unit of ohms, designated . Thus,
The resistance Rof an element denotes its ability to resist the ﬂow of
electric current; it is measured in ohms ( ).
We may deduce from Eq. (2.3) that
(2.4)
so that
To apply Ohm’s law as stated in Eq. (2.3), we must pay careful
attention to the current direction and voltage polarity. The direction ofcurrent iand the polarity of voltage vmust conform with the passive1 /H9024/H110051 V/AR/H11005v

Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854), a German physicist, in 1826
experimentally determined the most basic law relating voltage and cur-
rent for a resistor. Ohm’s work was initially denied by critics.
Born of humble beginnings in Erlangen, Bavaria, Ohm threw him-
self into electrical research. His efforts resulted in his famous law.He was awarded the Copley Medal in 1841 by the Royal Society ofLondon. In 1849, he was given the Professor of Physics chair by theUniversity of Munich. To honor him, the unit of resistance was namedthe ohm.Historicalale29559_ch02.qxd  07/21/2008  10:49 AM  Page 31

from a higher potential to a lower potential in order for . If cur-rent ﬂows from a lower potential to a higher potential, .
Since the value of R can range from zero to inﬁnity, it is impor-
tant that we consider the two extreme possible values of R. An element
with is called a short circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.2(a). For a short
circuit,

showing that the voltage is zero but the current could be anything. Inpractice, a short circuit is usually a connecting wire assumed to be aperfect conductor. Thus,
A short circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero.
Similarly, an element with is known as an open circuit , as
shown in Fig. 2.2(b). For an open circuit,

indicating that the current is zero though the voltage could be anything.Thus,
An open circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching inﬁnity.
Aresistor is either ﬁxed or variable. Most resistors are of the ﬁxed
type, meaning their resistance remains constant. The two common typesof ﬁxed resistors (wirewound and composition) are shown in Fig. 2.3.The composition resistors are used when large resistance is needed.The circuit symbol in Fig. 2.1(b) is for a ﬁxed resistor. Variable resis-tors have adjustable resistance. The symbol for a variable resistor isshown in Fig. 2.4(a). A common variable resistor is known as a poten-
tiometer or potfor short, with the symbol shown in Fig. 2.4(b). The
pot is a three-terminal element with a sliding contact or wiper. By slid-ing the wiper, the resistances between the wiper terminal and the ﬁxedterminals vary. Like ﬁxed resistors, variable resistors can be of eitherwirewound or composition type, as shown in Fig. 2.5.

circuit components including resistors are either surface mounted or
integrated, as typically shown in Fig. 2.6.
It should be pointed out that not all resistors obey Ohm’s law. A
resistor that obeys Ohm’s law is known as a linear resistor. It has a
constant resistance and thus its current-voltage characteristic is as illus-trated in Fig. 2.7(a): its i-v graph is a straight line passing through the
origin. A nonlinear resistor does not obey Ohm’s law. Its resistance
varies with current and its i -vcharacteristic is typically shown in
Fig. 2.7(b). Examples of devices with nonlinear resistance are the light-bulb and the diode. Although all practical resistors may exhibit nonlin-ear behavior under certain conditions, we will assume in this book thatall elements actually designated as resistors are linear.
Auseful quantity in circuit analysis is the reciprocal of resistance
R, known as conductance and denoted by G:
(2.7)
The conductance is a measure of how well an element will con-
duct electric current. The unit of conductance is the mho (ohm spelled
backward) or reciprocal ohm, with symbol , the inverted omega.Although engineers often use the mho, in this book we prefer to usethe siemens (S), the SI unit of conductance:
(2.8)
Thus,
Conductance is the ability of an element to conduct electric current;
it is measured in mhos ( ) or siemens (S).
The same resistance can be expressed in ohms or siemens. For
example, is the same as 0.1 S. From Eq. (2.7), we may write
(2.9)
The power dissipated by a resistor can be expressed in terms of R.
Using Eqs. (1.7) and (2.3),
(2.10)
The power dissipated by a resistor may also be expressed in terms ofGas
(2.11)
We should note two things from Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11):
1. The power dissipated in a resistor is a nonlinear function of either
current or voltage.
2. Since Rand Gare positive quantities, the power dissipated in a
resistor is always positive. Thus, a resistor always absorbs powerfrom the circuit. This conﬁrms the idea that a resistor is a passiveelement, incapable of generating energy.p/H11005vi/H11005v

Nodes, Branches, and Loops
Since the elements of an electric circuit can be interconnected in sev-
eral ways, we need to understand some basic concepts of networktopology. To differentiate between a circuit and a network, we mayregard a network as an interconnection of elements or devices, whereasa circuit is a network providing one or more closed paths. The con-vention, when addressing network topology, is to use the word networkrather than circuit. We do this even though the words network and cir-cuit mean the same thing when used in this context. In network topol-ogy, we study the properties relating to the placement of elements inthe network and the geometric conﬁguration of the network. Such ele-ments include branches, nodes, and loops.
A branch represents a single element such as a voltage source or a
resistor.
In other words, a branch represents any two-terminal element. The cir-cuit in Fig. 2.10 has ﬁve branches, namely, the 10-V voltage source,the 2-A current source, and the three resistors.
A node is the point of connection between two or more branches.
Anode is usually indicated by a dot in a circuit. If a short circuit (a
connecting wire) connects two nodes, the two nodes constitute a sin-gle node. The circuit in Fig. 2.10 has three nodes , and c. Notice
that the three points that form node b are connected by perfectly con-
ducting wires and therefore constitute a single point. The same is trueof the four points forming node c. We demonstrate that the circuit in
Fig. 2.10 has only three nodes by redrawing the circuit in Fig. 2.11.The two circuits in Figs. 2.10 and 2.11 are identical. However, for thesake of clarity, nodes b and care spread out with perfect conductors

36 Chapter 2 Basic Laws
A loop is any closed path in a circuit.
Aloop is a closed path formed by starting at a node, passing through a
set of nodes, and returning to the starting node without passing through
any node more than once. A loop is said to be independent if it contains
at least one branch which is not a part of any other independent loop.Independent loops or paths result in independent sets of equations.
It is possible to form an independent set of loops where one of the
loops does not contain such a branch. In Fig. 2.11, abca with the 
resistor is independent. A second loop with the resistor and the cur-rent source is independent. The third loop could be the one with the resistor in parallel with the resistor. This does form an independentset of loops.
Anetwork with bbranches, nnodes, and lindependent loops will
satisfy the fundamental theorem of network topology:
(2.12)
As the next two deﬁnitions show, circuit topology is of great value
to the study of voltages and currents in an electric circuit.
Two or more elements are in series if they exclusively share a single
node and consequently carry the same current.
Two or more elements are in parallel if they are connected to the same
two nodes and consequently have the same voltage across them.
Elements are in series when they are chain-connected or connected
sequentially, end to end. For example, two elements are in series ifthey share one common node and no other element is connected tothat common node. Elements in parallel are connected to the same pairof terminals. Elements may be connected in a way that they are nei-ther in series nor in parallel. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2.10, the volt-age source and the 5- resistor are in series because the same currentwill ﬂow through them. The 2- resistor, the 3- resistor, and the cur-rent source are in parallel because they are connected to the same twonodes band cand consequently have the same voltage across them.
The 5- and 2- resistors are neither in series nor in parallel witheach other./H9024 /H9024/H9024 /H9024/H9024b/H11005l/H11001n/H1100213/H90242/H90243/H90242/H9024

Since there are four elements in the circuit, the circuit has fourbranches: 10 V , , and 2 A. The circuit has three nodes asidentiﬁed in Fig. 2.13. The 5- resistor is in series with the 10-Vvoltage source because the same current would ﬂow in both.

Kirchhoff’s Laws
Ohm’s law by itself is not sufﬁcient to analyze circuits. However, when
it is coupled with Kirchhoff’s two laws, we have a sufﬁcient, powerfulset of tools for analyzing a large variety of electric circuits. Kirchhoff’slaws were ﬁrst introduced in 1847 by the German physicist GustavRobert Kirchhoff (1824–1887). These laws are formally known asKirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL).
Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law is based on the law of conservation of charge,
which requires that the algebraic sum of charges within a system cannotchange.
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents
entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero.
Mathematically, KCL implies that

entering a node may be regarded as positive, while currents leaving the
node may be taken as negative or vice versa.
To prove KCL, assume a set of currents ﬂow
into a node. The algebraic sum of currents at the node is
(2.14)
Integrating both sides of Eq. (2.14) gives
(2.15)
where and But the law of conserva-
tion of electric charge requires that the algebraic sum of electric
charges at the node must not change; that is, the node stores no netcharge. Thus conﬁrming the validity of KCL.
Consider the node in Fig. 2.16. Applying KCL gives
(2.16)
since currents , and are entering the node, while currents and
are leaving it. By rearranging the terms, we get
(2.17)
Equation (2.17) is an alternative form of KCL:
The sum of the currents entering a node is equal to the sum of the cur-
rents leaving the node.
Note that KCL also applies to a closed boundary. This may be
regarded as a generalized case, because a node may be regarded as a
closed surface shrunk to a point. In two dimensions, a closed bound-ary is the same as a closed path. As typically illustrated in the circuitof Fig. 2.17, the total current entering the closed surface is equal to thetotal current leaving the surface.
Asimple application of KCL is combining current sources in par-
allel. The combined current is the algebraic sum of the current suppliedby the individual sources. For example, the current sources shown ini

Two sources (or circuits in general) are
said to be equivalent if they have the
same i-vrelationship at a pair of
terminals.Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887), a German physicist, stated
two basic laws in 1847 concerning the relationship between the cur-
rents and voltages in an electrical network. Kirchhoff’s laws, alongwith Ohm’s law, form the basis of circuit theory.
Born the son of a lawyer in Konigsberg, East Prussia, Kirchhoff
entered the University of Konigsberg at age 18 and later became a lec-turer in Berlin. His collaborative work in spectroscopy with Germanchemist Robert Bunsen led to the discovery of cesium in 1860 andrubidium in 1861. Kirchhoff was also credited with the Kirchhoff lawof radiation. Thus Kirchhoff is famous among engineers, chemists, andphysicists.ale29559_ch02.qxd  07/21/2008  10:49 AM  Page 38
Fig. 2.18(a) can be combined as in Fig. 2.18(b). The combined or
equivalent current source can be found by applying KCL to node a.
or

Acircuit cannot contain two different currents, and , in series,
unless ; otherwise KCL will be violated.
Kirchhoff’s second law is based on the principle of conservation
of energy:
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all volt-
ages around a closed path (or loop) is zero.
Expressed mathematically, KVL states that
(2.19)
where Mis the number of voltages in the loop (or the number of
branches in the loop) and is the mth voltage.
To illustrate KVL, consider the circuit in Fig. 2.19. The sign on
each voltage is the polarity of the terminal encountered ﬁrst as wetravel around the loop. We can start with any branch and go aroundthe loop either clockwise or counterclockwise. Suppose we start withthe voltage source and go clockwise around the loop as shown; thenvoltages would be and in that order. For
example, as we reach branch 3, the positive terminal is met ﬁrst; hence,we have For branch 4, we reach the negative terminal ﬁrst; hence,
Thus, KVL yields
(2.20)
Rearranging terms gives
(2.21)
which may be interpreted as
(2.22)
This is an alternative form of KVL. Notice that if we had traveledcounterclockwise, the result would have been and which is the same as before except that the signs are reversed.Hence, Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21) remain the same.
When voltage sources are connected in series, KVL can be applied
to obtain the total voltage. The combined voltage is the algebraic sumof the voltages of the individual sources. For example, for the voltagesources shown in Fig. 2.20(a), the combined or equivalent voltagesource in Fig. 2.20(b) is obtained by applying KVL.

Series Resistors and Voltage Division
The need to combine resistors in series or in parallel occurs so fre-
quently that it warrants special attention. The process of combining theresistors is facilitated by combining two of them at a time. With thisin mind, consider the single-loop circuit of Fig. 2.29. The two resistors2.5ale29559_ch02.qxd  07/09/2008  11:19 AM  Page 43

are in series, since the same current i ﬂows in both of them. Applying
Ohm’s law to each of the resistors, we obtain
(2.24)
If we apply KVL to the loop (moving in the clockwise direction), we
have
(2.25)
Combining Eqs. (2.24) and (2.25), we get
(2.26)
or
(2.27)
Notice that Eq. (2.26) can be written as
(2.28)
implying that the two resistors can be replaced by an equivalent resis-tor ; that is,
(2.29)
Thus, Fig. 2.29 can be replaced by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 2.30.The two circuits in Figs. 2.29 and 2.30 are equivalent because theyexhibit the same voltage-current relationships at the terminals a-b. Anequivalent circuit such as the one in Fig. 2.30 is useful in simplifyingthe analysis of a circuit. In general,
The equivalent resistance of any number of resistors connected in
series is the sum of the individual resistances.
For Nresistors in series then,
(2.30)
To determine the voltage across each resistor in Fig. 2.29, we sub-
stitute Eq. (2.26) into Eq. (2.24) and obtain
(2.31)
Notice that the source voltage vis divided among the resistors in direct
proportion to their resistances; the larger the resistance, the larger thevoltage drop. This is called the principle of voltage division, and the
circuit in Fig. 2.29 is called a voltage divider . In general, if a voltage
divider has N resistors in series with the source volt-
age v, the nth resistor ( ) will have a voltage drop of

Parallel Resistors 
and Current Division
Consider the circuit in Fig. 2.31, where two resistors are connected
in parallel and therefore have the same voltage across them. FromOhm’s law,
or
(2.33)
Applying KCL at node agives the total current i as
(2.34)
Substituting Eq. (2.33) into Eq. (2.34), we get
(2.35)
where is the equivalent resistance of the resistors in parallel:
(2.36)
or
or
(2.37)
Thus,
The equivalent resistance of two parallel resistors is equal to the prod-
uct of their resistances divided by their sum.
It must be emphasized that this applies only to two resistors in paral-
lel. From Eq. (2.37), if then 
We can extend the result in Eq. (2.36) to the general case of a cir-
cuit with N resistors in parallel. The equivalent resistance is

Note that is always smaller than the resistance of the smallest resis-tor in the parallel combination. If , then

(a) A shorted circuit, (b) an open circuit.For example, if four 100- resistors are connected in parallel, their
equivalent resistance is 
It is often more convenient to use conductance rather than resist-
ance when dealing with resistors in parallel. From Eq. (2.38), the equiv-alent conductance for N resistors in parallel is
(2.40)
where Equation (2.40) states:
The equivalent conductance of resistors connected in parallel is the
sum of their individual conductances.
This means that we may replace the circuit in Fig. 2.31 with that inFig. 2.32. Notice the similarity between Eqs. (2.30) and (2.40). Theequivalent conductance of parallel resistors is obtained the same wayas the equivalent resistance of series resistors. In the same manner,the equivalent conductance of resistors in series is obtained justthe same way as the resistance of resistors in parallel. Thus theequivalent conductance of N resistors in series (such as shown in
Fig. 2.29) is
(2.41)
Given the total current i entering node a in Fig. 2.31, how do we
obtain current and We know that the equivalent resistor has thesame voltage, or
(2.42)
Combining Eqs. (2.33) and (2.42) results in
(2.43)
which shows that the total current iis shared by the resistors in
inverse proportion to their resistances. This is known as the princi-
ple of current division , and the circuit in Fig. 2.31 is known as a
current divider. Notice that the larger current flows through thesmaller resistance.
As an extreme case, suppose one of the resistors in Fig. 2.31 is
zero, say ; that is, is a short circuit, as shown inFig. 2.33(a). From Eq. (2.43), implies that . This
means that the entire current i bypasses and ﬂows through the
short circuit , the path of least resistance. Thus when a circuit R

in mind:
1.The equivalent resistance [See what happens when
in Eq. (2.37).]
2. The entire current ﬂows through the short circuit.
As another extreme case, suppose that is, is an open
circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.33(b). The current still ﬂows through thepath of least resistance, By taking the limit of Eq. (2.37) as we obtain in this case.
If we divide both the numerator and denominator by Eq. (2.43)

tors in series and parallel and reduce a resistive network to a singleequivalent resistance Such an equivalent resistance is the resist-

Find the equivalent conductance for the circuit in Fig. 2.40(a).
Solution:
The 8-S and 12-S resistors are in parallel, so their conductance is
This 20-S resistor is now in series with 5 S as shown in Fig. 2.40(b)
so that the combined conductance is
This is in parallel with the 6-S resistor. Hence,
We should note that the circuit in Fig. 2.40(a) is the same as that

Find and in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.42(a). Calculate the power

Solution:
The 6- and 3- resistors are in parallel, so their combined resistance is
Thus our circuit reduces to that shown in Fig. 2.42(b). Notice that is
not affected by the combination of the resistors because the resistors arein parallel and therefore have the same voltage From Fig. 2.42(b),we can obtain in two ways. One way is to apply Ohm’s law to get

division, since the 12 V in Fig. 2.42(b) is divided between the 4- and

Similarly, can be obtained in two ways. One approach is to apply

Wye-Delta Transformations
Situations often arise in circuit analysis when the resistors are neither inparallel nor in series. For example, consider the bridge circuit in Fig. 2.46.
How do we combine resistors through when the resistors are neither
in series nor in parallel? Many circuits of the type shown in Fig. 2.46can be simpliﬁed by using three-terminal equivalent networks. These areR

Delta to Wye Conversion
Suppose it is more convenient to work with a wye network in a place
where the circuit contains a delta conﬁguration. We superimpose a wyenetwork on the existing delta network and ﬁnd the equivalent resist-ances in the wye network. To obtain the equivalent resistances in thewye network, we compare the two networks and make sure that theresistance between each pair of nodes in the (or ) network is the
same as the resistance between the same pair of nodes in the Y (or T)network. For terminals 1 and 2 in Figs. 2.47 and 2.48, for example,

Obtain the equivalent resistance for the circuit in Fig. 2.52 and use
it to ﬁnd current i.
Solution:
1.Deﬁne. The problem is clearly deﬁned. Please note, this part
normally will deservedly take much more time.
2.Present. Clearly, when we remove the voltage source, we end
up with a purely resistive circuit. Since it is composed of deltas
and wyes, we have a more complex process of combining theelements together. We can use wye-delta transformations as oneapproach to ﬁnd a solution. It is useful to locate the wyes (thereare two of them, one at n and the other at c) and the deltas
(there are three: can, abn, cnb).
3.Alternative. There are different approaches that can be used to
solve this problem. Since the focus of Sec. 2.7 is the wye-deltatransformation, this should be the technique to use. Anotherapproach would be to solve for the equivalent resistance byinjecting one amp into the circuit and ﬁnding the voltagebetween aand b; we will learn about this approach in Chap. 4.
The approach we can apply here as a check would be to use
a wye-delta transformation as the ﬁrst solution to the problem.Later we can check the solution by starting with a delta-wyetransformation.
4.Attempt. In this circuit, there are two Y networks and three 
networks. Transforming just one of these will simplify the circuit.If we convert the Y network comprising the 5- 10- and20- resistors, we may select

at the resistance between d and b, we have two series

This is in series with the resistor, both of which are in

So far, we have assumed that connect-
ing wires are perfect conductors (i.e.,conductors of zero resistance). In realphysical systems, however, the resist-ance of the connecting wire may beappreciably large, and the modelingof the system must include thatresistance.Applications
Resistors are often used to model devices that convert electrical energy
into heat or other forms of energy. Such devices include conductingwire, lightbulbs, electric heaters, stoves, ovens, and loudspeakers. Inthis section, we will consider two real-life problems that apply the con-cepts developed in this chapter: electrical lighting systems and designof dc meters.
2.8.1. Lighting Systems
Lighting systems, such as in a house or on a Christmas tree, often con-sist of N lamps connected either in parallel or in series, as shown in
Fig. 2.55. Each lamp is modeled as a resistor. Assuming that all the lampsare identical and is the power-line voltage, the voltage across eachlamp is for the parallel connection and for the series connec-tion. The series connection is easy to manufacture but is seldom usedin practice, for at least two reasons. First, it is less reliable; when a lampfails, all the lamps go out. Second, it is harder to maintain; when a lampis bad, one must test all the lamps one by one to detect the faulty one.V

Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) was perhaps the greatest
American inventor. He patented 1093 inventions, including such
history-making inventions as the incandescent electric bulb, the phono-graph, and the ﬁrst commercial motion pictures.
Born in Milan, Ohio, the youngest of seven children, Edison received
only three months of formal education because he hated school. He washome-schooled by his mother and quickly began to read on his own. In1868, Edison read one of Faraday’s books and found his calling. Hemoved to Menlo Park, New Jersey, in 1876, where he managed a well-staffed research laboratory. Most of his inventions came out of thislaboratory. His laboratory served as a model for modern research organ-izations. Because of his diverse interests and the overwhelming numberof his inventions and patents, Edison began to establish manufacturingcompanies for making the devices he invented. He designed the ﬁrst elec-tric power station to supply electric light. Formal electrical engineeringeducation began in the mid-1880s with Edison as a role model and leader.Historical

2.8.2 Design of DC Meters
By their nature, resistors are used to control the ﬂow of current. We
take advantage of this property in several applications, such as in apotentiometer (Fig. 2.57). The word potentiometer, derived from the
words potential and meter, implies that potential can be metered out.
The potentiometer (or pot for short) is a three-terminal device that oper-ates on the principle of voltage division. It is essentially an adjustablevoltage divider. As a voltage regulator, it is used as a volume or levelcontrol on radios, TVs, and other devices. In Fig. 2.57,

Answer: 0.364 A (parallel), 3.64 A (series).Practice Problem 2.16ale29559_ch02.qxd  07/09/2008  11:19 AM  Page 60

where Thus, decreases or increases as the sliding
contact of the pot moves toward c or a, respectively.
Another application where resistors are used to control current ﬂow
is in the analog dc meters—the ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter,
which measure current, voltage, and resistance, respectively. Each ofthese meters employs the d’Arsonval meter movement, shown inFig. 2.58. The movement consists essentially of a movable iron-core coilmounted on a pivot between the poles of a permanent magnet. Whencurrent ﬂows through the coil, it creates a torque which causes the pointerto deﬂect. The amount of current through the coil determines the deﬂec-tion of the pointer, which is registered on a scale attached to the metermovement. For example, if the meter movement is rated 1 mA, 50 itwould take 1 mA to cause a full-scale deﬂection of the meter movement.By introducing additional circuitry to the d’Arsonval meter movement,an ammeter, voltmeter, or ohmmeter can be constructed.
Consider Fig. 2.59, where an analog voltmeter and ammeter are
connected to an element. The voltmeter measures the voltage across aload and is therefore connected in parallel with the element. As shown/H9024,V

An instrument capable of measuring
voltage, current, and resistance iscalled a

Ad’Arsonval meter movement.Figure 2.59
Connection of a voltmeter and an amme-
ter to an element.
in Fig. 2.60(a), the voltmeter consists of a d’Arsonval movement in
series with a resistor whose resistance is deliberately made verylarge (theoretically, inﬁnite), to minimize the current drawn from thecircuit. To extend the range of voltage that the meter can measure,series multiplier resistors are often connected with the voltmeters, asshown in Fig. 2.60(b). The multiple-range voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b) canmeasure voltage from 0 to 1 V , 0 to 10 V , or 0 to 100 V , depending onwhether the switch is connected to or respectively.
Let us calculate the multiplier resistor for the single-range volt-
meter in Fig. 2.60(a), or or for the multiple-rangevoltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b). We need to determine the value of to beconnected in series with the internal resistance of the voltmeter. Inany design, we consider the worst-case condition. In this case, theworst case occurs when the full-scale current ﬂows throughthe meter. This should also correspond to the maximum voltage read-ing or the full-scale voltage Since the multiplier resistance is inseries with the internal resistance

From this, we obtain
(2.60)
Similarly, the ammeter measures the current through the load and
is connected in series with it. As shown in Fig. 2.61(a), the ammeter
consists of a d’Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor whoseresistance is deliberately made very small (theoretically, zero) tominimize the voltage drop across it. To allow multiple ranges, shuntresistors are often connected in parallel with as shown inFig. 2.61(b). The shunt resistors allow the meter to measure in therange 0–10 mA, 0–100 mA, or 0–1 A, depending on whether the switchis connected to or respectively.
Now our objective is to obtain the multiplier shunt for the single-
range ammeter in Fig. 2.61(a), or or for the multiple-range ammeter in Fig. 2.61(b). We notice that and are in paralleland that at full-scale reading where is the currentthrough the shunt resistor Applying the current division principleyields

As mentioned, the types of meters we have discussed are known
as analog meters and are based on the d’Arsonval meter movement.
Another type of meter, called a digital meter, is based on active circuit
elements such as op amps. For example, a digital multimeter displaysmeasurements of dc or ac voltage, current, and resistance as discretenumbers, instead of using a pointer deﬂection on a continuous scale asin an analog multimeter. Digital meters are what you would most likelyuse in a modern lab. However, the design of digital meters is beyondthe scope of this book.R

Samuel F. B. Morse (1791–1872), an American painter, invented
the telegraph, the first practical, commercialized application of
electricity.
Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts and studied at Yale
and the Royal Academy of Arts in London to become an artist. In the1830s, he became intrigued with developing a telegraph. He had aworking model by 1836 and applied for a patent in 1838. The U.S.Senate appropriated funds for Morse to construct a telegraph linebetween Baltimore and Washington, D.C. On May 24, 1844, he sentthe famous ﬁrst message: “What hath God wrought!” Morse also devel-oped a code of dots and dashes for letters and numbers, for sendingmessages on the telegraph. The development of the telegraph led to theinvention of the telephone.Historical

4. A branch is a single two-terminal element in an electric circuit. A
node is the point of connection between two or more branches. Aloop is a closed path in a circuit. The number of branches b, the
number of nodes n, and the number of independent loops lin a
network are related as
5. Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the currents at any node
algebraically sum to zero. In other words, the sum of the currentsentering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.

No great work is ever done in a hurry. To develop a great scientiﬁc
discovery, to print a great picture, to write an immortal poem, tobecome a minister, or a famous general—to do anything great requirestime, patience, and perseverance. These things are done by degrees,“little by little.”

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Electronics
One area of application for electric circuit analysis is electronics. Theterm electronics was originally used to distinguish circuits of very low
current levels. This distinction no longer holds, as power semiconduc-tor devices operate at high levels of current. Today, electronics isregarded as the science of the motion of charges in a gas, vacuum, orsemiconductor. Modern electronics involves transistors and transistorcircuits. The earlier electronic circuits were assembled from compo-nents. Many electronic circuits are now produced as integrated circuits,fabricated in a semiconductor substrate or chip.
Electronic circuits ﬁnd applications in many areas, such as automa-
tion, broadcasting, computers, and instrumentation. The range of devicesthat use electronic circuits is enormous and is limited only by our imag-ination. Radio, television, computers, and stereo systems are but a few.
An electrical engineer usually performs diverse functions and is likely
to use, design, or construct systems that incorporate some form of elec-tronic circuits. Therefore, an understanding of the operation and analysisof electronics is essential to the electrical engineer. Electronics hasbecome a specialty distinct from other disciplines within electrical engi-neering. Because the ﬁeld of electronics is ever advancing, an electronicsengineer must update his/her knowledge from time to time. The best wayto do this is by being a member of a professional organization such asthe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). With a mem-bership of over 300,000, the IEEE is the largest professional organizationin the world. Members beneﬁt immensely from the numerous magazines,journals, transactions, and conference/symposium proceedings publishedyearly by IEEE. You should consider becoming an IEEE member.

Introduction
Having understood the fundamental laws of circuit theory (Ohm’s law
and Kirchhoff’s laws), we are now prepared to apply these laws todevelop two powerful techniques for circuit analysis: nodal analysis,which is based on a systematic application of Kirchhoff’s current law(KCL), and mesh analysis, which is based on a systematic applicationof Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL). The two techniques are so impor-tant that this chapter should be regarded as the most important in thebook. Students are therefore encouraged to pay careful attention.
With the two techniques to be developed in this chapter, we can ana-
lyze any linear circuit by obtaining a set of simultaneous equations thatare then solved to obtain the required values of current or voltage. Onemethod of solving simultaneous equations involves Cramer’s rule, whichallows us to calculate circuit variables as a quotient of determinants. Theexamples in the chapter will illustrate this method; Appendix A alsobrieﬂy summarizes the essentials the reader needs to know for applyingCramer’s rule. Another method of solving simultaneous equations is touse MATLAB , a computer software discussed in Appendix E.
Also in this chapter, we introduce the use of PSpice for Windows ,
a circuit simulation computer software program that we will usethroughout the text. Finally, we apply the techniques learned in thischapter to analyze transistor circuits.
Nodal Analysis
Nodal analysis provides a general procedure for analyzing circuitsusing node voltages as the circuit variables. Choosing node voltagesinstead of element voltages as circuit variables is convenient andreduces the number of equations one must solve simultaneously.
To simplify matters, we shall assume in this section that circuits
do not contain voltage sources. Circuits that contain voltage sourceswill be analyzed in the next section.
In nodal analysis, we are interested in ﬁnding the node voltages.
Given a circuit with n nodes without voltage sources, the nodal analy-
sis of the circuit involves taking the following three steps.3.23.182 Chapter 3 Methods of Analysis
Nodal analysis is also known as the
node-voltage method .
Steps to Determine Node Voltages:
1.Select a node as the reference node. Assign voltages 
to the remaining nodes. The voltages are
referenced with respect to the reference node.
2. Apply KCL to each of the nonreference nodes. Use
Ohm’s law to express the branch currents in terms of node
voltages.
3.Solve the resulting simultaneous equations to obtain theunknown node voltages.n/H110021n/H110021 v2,p, vn/H110021v1,
We shall now explain and apply these three steps.
The ﬁrst step in nodal analysis is selecting a node as the reference
or datum node. The reference node is commonly called the groundale29559_ch03.qxd  07/08/2008  10:46 AM  Page 82

since it is assumed to have zero potential. A reference node is indicated
by any of the three symbols in Fig. 3.1. The type of ground in Fig. 3.1(c)is called a chassis ground and is used in devices where the case, enclo-
sure, or chassis acts as a reference point for all circuits. When thepotential of the earth is used as reference, we use the earth ground in
Fig. 3.1(a) or (b). We shall always use the symbol in Fig. 3.1(b).
Once we have selected a reference node, we assign voltage desig-
nations to nonreference nodes. Consider, for example, the circuit inFig. 3.2(a). Node 0 is the reference node while nodes 1 and2 are assigned voltages and respectively. Keep in mind that thenode voltages are deﬁned with respect to the reference node. As illus-trated in Fig. 3.2(a), each node voltage is the voltage rise from the ref-erence node to the corresponding nonreference node or simply thevoltage of that node with respect to the reference node.
As the second step, we apply KCL to each nonreference node in
the circuit. To avoid putting too much information on the same circuit,the circuit in Fig. 3.2(a) is redrawn in Fig. 3.2(b), where we now add
and as the currents through resistors and respec-
tively. At node 1, applying KCL gives
(3.1)
At node 2,
(3.2)
We now apply Ohm’s law to express the unknown currents and
in terms of node voltages. The key idea to bear in mind is that, since
resistance is a passive element, by the passive sign convention, currentmust always ﬂow from a higher potential to a lower potential.i

The number of nonreference nodes is
equal to the number of independentequations that we will derive.

Note that this principle is in agreement with the way we deﬁned resist-
ance in Chapter 2 (see Fig. 2.1). With this in mind, we obtain fromFig. 3.2(b),

In terms of the conductances, Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) become
(3.7)
(3.8)
The third step in nodal analysis is to solve for the node voltages.
If we apply KCL to nonreference nodes, we obtain simul-
taneous equations such as Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8). Forthe circuit of Fig. 3.2, we solve Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8)to obtain the node voltages and using any standard method, suchas the substitution method, the elimination method, Cramer’s rule, ormatrix inversion. To use either of the last two methods, one must castthe simultaneous equations in matrix form. For example, Eqs. (3.7) and(3.8) can be cast in matrix form as
(3.9)
which can be solved to get and Equation 3.9 will be generalizedin Section 3.6. The simultaneous equations may also be solved usingcalculators or with software packages such as MATLAB , Mathcad,
Maple , and Quattro Pro.v

Appendix A discusses how to use

Calculate the node voltages in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.3(a).
Solution:
Consider Fig. 3.3(b), where the circuit in Fig. 3.3(a) has been preparedfor nodal analysis. Notice how the currents are selected for theapplication of KCL. Except for the branches with current sources, thelabeling of the currents is arbitrary but consistent. (By consistent, wemean that if, for example, we assume that enters the resistorfrom the left-hand side, must leave the resistor from the right-handside.) The reference node is selected, and the node voltages and are now to be determined.
At node 1, applying KCL and Ohm’s law gives

Nodal Analysis with Voltage Sources
Wenow consider how voltage sources affect nodal analysis. We use the
circuit in Fig. 3.7 for illustration. Consider the following two possibilities.
■CASE 1 If a voltage source is connected between the reference
node and a nonreference node, we simply set the voltage at the non-
reference node equal to the voltage of the voltage source. In Fig. 3.7,for example,
(3.10)
Thus, our analysis is somewhat simpliﬁed by this knowledge of the volt-age at this node.
■CASE 2 If the voltage source (dependent or independent) is con-
nected between two nonreference nodes, the two nonreference nodesv1/H1100510 V3.3ale29559_ch03.qxd  07/08/2008  10:46 AM  Page 88

A supernode is formed by enclosing a (dependent or independent)
voltage source connected between two nonreference nodes and any
elements connected in parallel with it.form a generalized node or supernode; we apply both KCL and KVL
to determine the node voltages.3.3 Nodal Analysis with Voltage Sources 89

A supernode may be regarded as a
closed surface enclosing the voltagesource and its two nodes.
In Fig. 3.7, nodes 2 and 3 form a supernode. (We could have more
than two nodes forming a single supernode. For example, see the cir-cuit in Fig. 3.14.) We analyze a circuit with supernodes using thesame three steps mentioned in the previous section except that thesupernodes are treated differently. Why? Because an essential com-ponent of nodal analysis is applying KCL, which requires knowingthe current through each element. There is no way of knowing thecurrent through a voltage source in advance. However, KCL mustbe satisﬁed at a supernode like any other node. Hence, at the super-node in Fig. 3.7,

To apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the supernode in Fig. 3.7, we
redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.8. Going around the loop in theclockwise direction gives
(3.12)
From Eqs. (3.10), (3.11b), and (3.12), we obtain the node voltages.
Note the following properties of a supernode:
1.The voltage source inside the supernode provides a constraintequation needed to solve for the node voltages.
2. A supernode has no voltage of its own.3. A supernode requires the application of both KCL and KVL./H11002v

Mesh Analysis
Mesh analysis provides another general procedure for analyzing cir-
cuits, using mesh currents as the circuit variables. Using mesh currentsinstead of element currents as circuit variables is convenient andreduces the number of equations that must be solved simultaneously.Recall that a loop is a closed path with no node passed more than once.Amesh is a loop that does not contain any other loop within it.
Nodal analysis applies KCL to ﬁnd unknown voltages in a given
circuit, while mesh analysis applies KVL to ﬁnd unknown currents.Mesh analysis is not quite as general as nodal analysis because it isonly applicable to a circuit that is planar. A planar circuit is one that
can be drawn in a plane with no branches crossing one another; oth-erwise it is nonplanar. Acircuit may have crossing branches and still
be planar if it can be redrawn such that it has no crossing branches.For example, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a) has two crossing branches, butit can be redrawn as in Fig. 3.15(b). Hence, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a)is planar. However, the circuit in Fig. 3.16 is nonplanar, because thereis no way to redraw it and avoid the branches crossing. Nonplanar cir-cuits can be handled using nodal analysis, but they will not be con-sidered in this text.3.4
Mesh analysis is also known as loop
analysis or the mesh-current method.

To illustrate the steps, consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17. The ﬁrst
step requires that mesh currents and are assigned to meshes 1 and
2. Although a mesh current may be assigned to each mesh in an arbi-trary direction, it is conventional to assume that each mesh currentﬂows clockwise.
As the second step, we apply KVL to each mesh. Applying KVL
to mesh 1, we obtain
or
(3.13)
For mesh 2, applying KVL givesor
(3.14)
Note in Eq. (3.13) that the coefﬁcient of is the sum of the resistances
in the ﬁrst mesh, while the coefﬁcient of is the negative of the resis-tance common to meshes 1 and 2. Now observe that the same is truein Eq. (3.14). This can serve as a shortcut way of writing the meshequations. We will exploit this idea in Section 3.6.i

Steps to Determine Mesh Currents:
1. Assign mesh currents to the nmeshes.
2.Apply KVL to each of the nmeshes. Use Ohm’s law to
express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents.
3. Solve the resulting n simultaneous equations to get the mesh
currents.i1, i2,p, in
The direction of the mesh current is
arbitrary—(clockwise or counterclock-wise)—and does not affect the validityof the solution.Although path abcdefa is a loop and
not a mesh, KVL still holds. This is the
reason for loosely using the terms
loop analysis and mesh analysis to
mean the same thing.In Fig. 3.17, for example, paths abefa and bcdeb are meshes, but path
abcdefa is not a mesh. The current through a mesh is known as mesh
current. In mesh analysis, we are interested in applying KVL to ﬁnd
the mesh currents in a given circuit.
In this section, we will apply mesh analysis to planar circuits that
do not contain current sources. In the next section, we will consider
circuits with current sources. In the mesh analysis of a circuit with nmeshes, we take the following three steps.
The shortcut way will not apply if one
mesh current is assumed clockwiseand the other assumed counter-clockwise, although this is permissible.ale29559_ch03.qxd  07/08/2008  10:46 AM  Page 94

The third step is to solve for the mesh currents. Putting Eqs. (3.13)
and (3.14) in matrix form yields
(3.15)
which can be solved to obtain the mesh currents and We are at
liberty to use any technique for solving the simultaneous equations.According to Eq. (2.12), if a circuit has nnodes, bbranches, and linde-
pendent loops or meshes, then Hence, lindependent
simultaneous equations are required to solve the circuit using meshanalysis.
Notice that the branch currents are different from the mesh cur-
rents unless the mesh is isolated. To distinguish between the two typesof currents, we use i for a mesh current and I for a branch current. The
current elements and are algebraic sums of the mesh currents.It is evident from Fig. 3.17 that

Applying mesh analysis to circuits containing current sources (dependent
or independent) may appear complicated. But it is actually much easierthan what we encountered in the previous section, because the presenceof the current sources reduces the number of equations. Consider thefollowing two possible cases.
■CASE 1 When a current source exists only in one mesh: Consider
the circuit in Fig. 3.22, for example. We set A and write amesh equation for the other mesh in the usual way; that is,
(3.17)
■CASE 2 When a current source exists between two meshes: Con-
sider the circuit in Fig. 3.23(a), for example. We create a supermesh
by excluding the current source and any elements connected in serieswith it, as shown in Fig. 3.23(b). Thus,/H1100210 /H110014i

As shown in Fig. 3.23(b), we create a supermesh as the periphery of
the two meshes and treat it differently. (If a circuit has two or moresupermeshes that intersect, they should be combined to form a largersupermesh.) Why treat the supermesh differently? Because mesh analy-sis applies KVL—which requires that we know the voltage across eachbranch—and we do not know the voltage across a current source inadvance. However, a supermesh must satisfy KVL like any other mesh.Therefore, applying KVL to the supermesh in Fig. 3.23(b) gives

Note the following properties of a supermesh:
1. The current source in the supermesh provides the constraint equa-
tion necessary to solve for the mesh currents.
2. A supermesh has no current of its own.
3. A supermesh requires the application of both KVL and KCL.i1/H11005/H11002 3.2 A,  i2/H110052.8 Ai2/H11005i1/H1100166i1/H1100114i2/H11005203.5 Mesh Analysis with Current Sources 99

by Inspection
This section presents a generalized procedure for nodal or mesh analy-
sis. It is a shortcut approach based on mere inspection of a circuit.
When all sources in a circuit are independent current sources, we
do not need to apply KCL to each node to obtain the node-voltageequations as we did in Section 3.2. We can obtain the equations bymere inspection of the circuit. As an example, let us reexamine the cir-cuit in Fig. 3.2, shown again in Fig. 3.26(a) for convenience. Thecircuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equations werederived in Section 3.2 as
(3.21)
Observe that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the conductancesconnected directly to node 1 or 2, while the off-diagonal terms are thenegatives of the conductances connected between the nodes. Also, eachterm on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.21) is the algebraic sum of thecurrents entering the node.
In general, if a circuit with independent current sources has Nnon-
reference nodes, the node-voltage equations can be written in terms ofthe conductances as

Gis called the conductance matrix; vis the output vector; and i is the
input vector. Equation (3.22) can be solved to obtain the unknown nodevoltages. Keep in mind that this is valid for circuits with only inde-pendent current sources and linear resistors.
Similarly, we can obtain mesh-current equations by inspection
when a linear resistive circuit has only independent voltage sources.Consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17, shown again in Fig. 3.26(b) for con-venience. The circuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equa-tions were derived in Section 3.4 as
(3.24)
We notice that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the resistances
in the related mesh, while each of the off-diagonal terms is the nega-tive of the resistance common to meshes 1 and 2. Each term on theright-hand side of Eq. (3.24) is the algebraic sum taken clockwise ofall independent voltage sources in the related mesh.
In general, if the circuit has N meshes, the mesh-current equations
can be expressed in terms of the resistances as

Nodal Versus Mesh Analysis
Both nodal and mesh analyses provide a systematic way of analyzinga complex network. Someone may ask: Given a network to be ana-lyzed, how do we know which method is better or more efﬁcient? Thechoice of the better method is dictated by two factors.3.7ale29559_ch03.qxd  07/08/2008  10:47 AM  Page 104

The ﬁrst factor is the nature of the particular network. Networks
that contain many series-connected elements, voltage sources, or super-
meshes are more suitable for mesh analysis, whereas networks withparallel-connected elements, current sources, or supernodes are moresuitable for nodal analysis. Also, a circuit with fewer nodes thanmeshes is better analyzed using nodal analysis, while a circuit withfewer meshes than nodes is better analyzed using mesh analysis. Thekey is to select the method that results in the smaller number ofequations.
The second factor is the information required. If node voltages are
required, it may be expedient to apply nodal analysis. If branch or meshcurrents are required, it may be better to use mesh analysis.
It is helpful to be familiar with both methods of analysis, for at
least two reasons. First, one method can be used to check the resultsfrom the other method, if possible. Second, since each method has itslimitations, only one method may be suitable for a particular problem.For example, mesh analysis is the only method to use in analyzing tran-sistor circuits, as we shall see in Section 3.9. But mesh analysis can-not easily be used to solve an op amp circuit, as we shall see in Chapter 5,because there is no direct way to obtain the voltage across the op ampitself. For nonplanar networks, nodal analysis is the only option,because mesh analysis only applies to planar networks. Also, nodalanalysis is more amenable to solution by computer, as it is easy to pro-gram. This allows one to analyze complicated circuits that defy handcalculation. A computer software package based on nodal analysis isintroduced next.
Circuit Analysis with PSpice
PSpice is a computer software circuit analysis program that we will
gradually learn to use throughout the course of this text. This sectionillustrates how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze the dc circuits we
have studied so far.
The reader is expected to review Sections D.1 through D.3 of
Appendix D before proceeding in this section. It should be noted thatPSpice is only helpful in determining branch voltages and currents
when the numerical values of all the circuit components are known.3.83.8 Circuit Analysis with PSpice 105
Appendix D provides a tutorial on
using PSpice for Windows .
Use PSpice to ﬁnd the node voltages in the circuit of Fig. 3.31.
Solution:
The ﬁrst step is to draw the given circuit using Schematics. If onefollows the instructions given in Appendix sections D.2 and D.3, theschematic in Fig. 3.32 is produced. Since this is a dc analysis, we usevoltage source VDC and current source IDC. The pseudocomponentVIEWPOINTS are added to display the required node voltages. Oncethe circuit is drawn and saved as exam310.sch, we run PSpice by

Most of us deal with electronic products on a routine basis and have
some experience with personal computers. A basic component forthe integrated circuits found in these electronics and computers is theactive, three-terminal device known as the transistor. Understanding
the transistor is essential before an engineer can start an electronic cir-cuit design.
Figure 3.37 depicts various kinds of transistors commercially avail-
able. There are two basic types of transistors: bipolar junction transis-tors (BJTs) and ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we consider only
the BJTs, which were the ﬁrst of the two and are still used today. Ourobjective is to present enough detail about the BJT to enable us to applythe techniques developed in this chapter to analyze dc transistor circuits.3.9ale29559_ch03.qxd  07/08/2008  10:47 AM  Page 107

108 Chapter 3 Methods of Analysis
William Schockley (1910–1989), John Bardeen (1908–1991), and
Walter Brattain (1902–1987) co-invented the transistor.
Nothing has had a greater impact on the transition from the “Indus-
trial Age” to the “Age of the Engineer” than the transistor. I am sure
that Dr. Shockley, Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain had no idea they wouldhave this incredible effect on our history. While working at Bell Lab-oratories, they successfully demonstrated the point-contact transistor,invented by Bardeen and Brattain in 1947, and the junction transistor,which Shockley conceived in 1948 and successfully produced in 1951.
It is interesting to note that the idea of the ﬁeld-effect transistor,
the most commonly used one today, was ﬁrst conceived in 1925–1928by J. E. Lilienfeld, a German immigrant to the United States. This isevident from his patents of what appears to be a ﬁeld-effect transistor.Unfortunately, the technology to realize this device had to wait until1954 when Shockley’s ﬁeld-effect transistor became a reality. Just thinkwhat today would be like if we had this transistor 30 years earlier!
For their contributions to the creation of the transistor, Dr. Shockley,
Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain received, in 1956, the Nobel Prize inphysics. It should be noted that Dr. Bardeen is the only individual towin two Nobel prizes in physics; the second came later for work insuperconductivity at the University of Illinois.

These equations show that, in the active mode, the BJT can be modeledas a dependent current-controlled current source. Thus, in circuit analy-sis, the dc equivalent model in Fig. 3.40(b) may be used to replace thenpntransistor in Fig. 3.40(a). Since in Eq. (3.32) is large, a small base
current controls large currents in the output circuit. Consequently, thebipolar transistor can serve as an ampliﬁer, producing both current gainand voltage gain. Such ampliﬁers can be used to furnish a considerableamount of power to transducers such as loudspeakers or control motors.bb/H11005a

It should be observed in the following examples that one cannot
directly analyze transistor circuits using nodal analysis because of the
potential difference between the terminals of the transistor. Only when thetransistor is replaced by its equivalent model can we apply nodal analysis.In fact, transistor circuits provide moti-
vation to study dependent sources.ale29559_ch03.qxd  07/08/2008  10:47 AM  Page 109

Summary
1. Nodal analysis is the application of Kirchhoff’s current law at the
nonreference nodes. (It is applicable to both planar and nonplanar
circuits.) We express the result in terms of the node voltages. Solv-ing the simultaneous equations yields the node voltages.
2. A supernode consists of two nonreference nodes connected by a
(dependent or independent) voltage source.
3. Mesh analysis is the application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law around
meshes in a planar circuit. We express the result in terms of meshcurrents. Solving the simultaneous equations yields the meshcurrents.3.10ale29559_ch03.qxd  07/08/2008  10:47 AM  Page 112

Review Questions 113
4. A supermesh consists of two meshes that have a (dependent or
independent) current source in common.
5. Nodal analysis is normally used when a circuit has fewer node
equations than mesh equations. Mesh analysis is normally used
when a circuit has fewer mesh equations than node equations.
6. Circuit analysis can be carried out using PSpice.
7. DC transistor circuits can be analyzed using the techniques cov-
ered in this chapter.

Your success as an engineer will be directly proportional to your ability
to communicate!
—Charles K. Alexanderchapter

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Enhancing Your Communication Skills
Taking a course in circuit analysis is one step in preparing yourself for
a career in electrical engineering. Enhancing your communication skills
while in school should also be part of that preparation, as a large partof your time will be spent communicating.
People in industry have complained again and again that graduat-
ing engineers are ill-prepared in written and oral communication. Anengineer who communicates effectively becomes a valuable asset.
You can probably speak or write easily and quickly. But how effec-
tively do you communicate? The art of effective communication is of
the utmost importance to your success as an engineer.
For engineers in industry, communication is key to promotability.
Consider the result of a survey of U.S. corporations that asked whatfactors inﬂuence managerial promotion. The survey includes a listingof 22 personal qualities and their importance in advancement. You maybe surprised to note that “technical skill based on experience” placedfourth from the bottom. Attributes such as self-conﬁdence, ambition,ﬂexibility, maturity, ability to make sound decisions, getting thingsdone with and through people, and capacity for hard work all rankedhigher. At the top of the list was “ability to communicate.” The higheryour professional career progresses, the more you will need to com-municate. Therefore, you should regard effective communication as animportant tool in your engineering tool chest.
Learning to communicate effectively is a lifelong task you should
always work toward. The best time to begin is while still in school.Continually look for opportunities to develop and strengthen your read-ing, writing, listening, and speaking skills. You can do this throughclassroom presentations, team projects, active participation in studentorganizations, and enrollment in communication courses. The risks areless now than later in the workplace.
Ability to communicate effectively is re-
garded by many as the most importantstep to an executive promotion.©I T Stock/Punchstockale29559_ch04.qxd  07/14/2008  02:51 PM  Page 127

Introduction
Amajor advantage of analyzing circuits using Kirchhoff’s laws as we
did in Chapter 3 is that we can analyze a circuit without tampering
with its original conﬁguration. A major disadvantage of this approachis that, for a large, complex circuit, tedious computation is involved.
The growth in areas of application of electric circuits has led to an
evolution from simple to complex circuits. To handle the complexity,engineers over the years have developed some theorems to simplify cir-cuit analysis. Such theorems include Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems.Since these theorems are applicable to linear circuits, we ﬁrst discuss the
concept of circuit linearity. In addition to circuit theorems, we discuss theconcepts of superposition, source transformation, and maximum powertransfer in this chapter. The concepts we develop are applied in the lastsection to source modeling and resistance measurement.
Linearity Property
Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationshipbetween cause and effect. Although the property applies to many cir-cuit elements, we shall limit its applicability to resistors in this chap-ter. The property is a combination of both the homogeneity (scaling)property and the additivity property.
The homogeneity property requires that if the input (also called the
excitation) is multiplied by a constant, then the output (also called theresponse ) is multiplied by the same constant. For a resistor, for exam-
ple, Ohm’s law relates the input i to the output v,
(4.1)
If the current is increased by a constant k, then the voltage increasescorrespondingly by k; that is,
(4.2)
The additivity property requires that the response to a sum of
inputs is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately.Using the voltage-current relationship of a resistor, if
(4.3a)
and
(4.3b)
then applying gives
(4.4)
We say that a resistor is a linear element because the voltage-current
relationship satisﬁes both the homogeneity and the additivity properties.
In general, a circuit is linear if it is both additive and homoge-
neous. A linear circuit consists of only linear elements, linear depend-ent sources, and independent sources.v/H11005(i

Throughout this book we consider only linear circuits. Note that since
(making it a quadratic function rather than a linear one),
the relationship between power and voltage (or current) is nonlinear.
Therefore, the theorems covered in this chapter are not applicable to power.
To illustrate the linearity principle, consider the linear circuit
shown in Fig. 4.1. The linear circuit has no independent sources insideit. It is excited by a voltage source which serves as the input. Thecircuit is terminated by a load R. We may take the current i through R
as the output. Suppose gives According to the lin-earity principle, will give By the same token,

A linear circuit is one whose output is linearly related (or directly pro-
portional) to its input.For example, when current i1ﬂows
through resistor R, the power is p1/H11005 Ri12,
and when current i2ﬂows through R, the
power is p2/H11005Ri22. If current i1/H11001i2ﬂows
through R, the power absorbed is p3/H11005

Superposition
If a circuit has two or more independent sources, one way to determine
the value of a speciﬁc variable (voltage or current) is to use nodal ormesh analysis as in Chapter 3. Another way is to determine the con-tribution of each independent source to the variable and then add themup. The latter approach is known as the superposition.
The idea of superposition rests on the linearity property.4.3130 Chapter 4 Circuit Theorems

The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current
through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the volt-
ages across (or currents through) that element due to each independ-ent source acting alone.Superposition is not limited to circuit
analysis but is applicable in manyﬁelds where cause and effect bear alinear relationship to one another.ale29559_ch04.qxd  07/08/2008  10:55 AM  Page 130

The principle of superposition helps us to analyze a linear circuit with
more than one independent source by calculating the contribution ofeach independent source separately. However, to apply the superposi-tion principle, we must keep two things in mind:
1. We consider one independent source at a time while all other inde-
pendent sources are turned off . This implies that we replace every
voltage source by 0 V (or a short circuit), and every current sourceby 0 A (or an open circuit). This way we obtain a simpler and moremanageable circuit.
2. Dependent sources are left intact because they are controlled by
circuit variables.
With these in mind, we apply the superposition principle in three
steps:4.3 Superposition 131
Other terms such as killed , made inac-
tive, deadened , or set equal to zero
are often used to convey the same
idea.
Steps to Apply Superposition Principle:
1. Turn off all independent sources except one source. Find the
output (voltage or current) due to that active source using
the techniques covered in Chapters 2 and 3.
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the other independent sources.3. Find the total contribution by adding algebraically all the
contributions due to the independent sources.
Analyzing a circuit using superposition has one major disadvan-
tage: it may very likely involve more work. If the circuit has three inde-pendent sources, we may have to analyze three simpler circuits eachproviding the contribution due to the respective individual source.However, superposition does help reduce a complex circuit to simplercircuits through replacement of voltage sources by short circuits andof current sources by open circuits.
Keep in mind that superposition is based on linearity. For this
reason, it is not applicable to the effect on power due to each source,because the power absorbed by a resistor depends on the square ofthe voltage or current. If the power value is needed, the currentthrough (or voltage across) the element must be calculated ﬁrst usingsuperposition.

Source Transformation
We have noticed that series-parallel combination and wye-delta trans-
formation help simplify circuits. Source transformation is another tool
for simplifying circuits. Basic to these tools is the concept of equiva-
lence. We recall that an equivalent circuit is one whose v-icharacter-
istics are identical with the original circuit.
In Section 3.6, we saw that node-voltage (or mesh-current) equa-
tions can be obtained by mere inspection of a circuit when the sources
are all independent current (or all independent voltage) sources. It istherefore expedient in circuit analysis to be able to substitute a voltagesource in series with a resistor for a current source in parallel with a4.4ale29559_ch04.qxd  07/08/2008  10:55 AM  Page 135

resistor, or vice versa, as shown in Fig. 4.15. Either substitution is
known as a source transformation .136 Chapter 4 Circuit Theorems
A source transformation is the process of replacing a voltage source

Transformation of independent sources.
The two circuits in Fig. 4.15 are equivalent—provided they have the

are short-circuited, the short-circuit current ﬂowing from ato bis

Like the wye-delta transformation we studied in Chapter 2, a
source transformation does not affect the remaining part of the circuit.
When applicable, source transformation is a powerful tool that allowscircuit manipulations to ease circuit analysis. However, we should keepthe following points in mind when dealing with source transformation.
1.Note from Fig. 4.15 (or Fig. 4.16) that the arrow of the current sourceis directed toward the positive terminal of the voltage source.
2. Note from Eq. (4.5) that source transformation is not possible when

a practical, nonideal voltage source, . Similarly, an ideal cur-rent source with cannot be replaced by a ﬁnite voltage source.More will be said on ideal and nonideal sources in Section 4.10.1.R/H11005/H11009R/HS110050R/H110050ale29559_ch04.qxd  07/08/2008  10:55 AM  Page 136

Thevenin’s Theorem
It often occurs in practice that a particular element in a circuit is vari-
able (usually called the load ) while other elements are ﬁxed. As a typ-
ical example, a household outlet terminal may be connected to differentappliances constituting a variable load. Each time the variable elementis changed, the entire circuit has to be analyzed all over again. To avoidthis problem, Thevenin’s theorem provides a technique by which theﬁxed part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit.
According to Thevenin’s theorem, the linear circuit in Fig. 4.23(a)
can be replaced by that in Fig. 4.23(b). (The load in Fig. 4.23 may bea single resistor or another circuit.) The circuit to the left of the ter-minals in Fig. 4.23(b) is known as the Thevenin equivalent circuit ;
it was developed in 1883 by M. Leon Thevenin (1857–1926), a Frenchtelegraph engineer.a-b4.54.5 Thevenin’s Theorem 139

Replacing a linear two-terminal circuit
by its Thevenin equivalent: (a) originalcircuit, (b) the Thevenin equivalentcircuit.Thevenin’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be
replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source VThin
series with a resistor RTh, where VThis the open-circuit voltage at the
terminals and RThis the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals
when the independent sources are turned off.
The proof of the theorem will be given later, in Section 4.7. Our
major concern right now is how to ﬁnd the Thevenin equivalent volt-
age and resistance . To do so, suppose the two circuits inFig. 4.23 are equivalent. Two circuits are said to be equivalent if they
have the same voltage-current relation at their terminals. Let us ﬁndout what will make the two circuits in Fig. 4.23 equivalent. If the ter-minals are made open-circuited (by removing the load), no currentﬂows, so that the open-circuit voltage across the terminals inFig. 4.23(a) must be equal to the voltage source in Fig. 4.23(b),since the two circuits are equivalent. Thus is the open-circuit volt-age across the terminals as shown in Fig. 4.24(a); that is,

Again, with the load disconnected and terminals open-
circuited, we turn off all independent sources. The input resistance
(or equivalent resistance) of the dead circuit at the terminals in Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to in Fig. 4.23(b) because the two circuitsare equivalent. Thus, is the input resistance at the terminals when theindependent sources are turned off, as shown in Fig. 4.24(b); that is,

To apply this idea in ﬁnding the Thevenin resistance , we need
to consider two cases.
■CASE 1 If the network has no dependent sources, we turn off all
independent sources. is the input resistance of the network look-
ing between terminals a and b, as shown in Fig. 4.24(b). 
■CASE 2 If the network has dependent sources, we turn off all
independent sources. As with superposition, dependent sources are notto be turned off because they are controlled by circuit variables. Weapply a voltage source at terminals aand band determine the result-
ing current . Then , as shown in Fig. 4.25(a). Alterna-tively, we may insert a current source at terminals a-bas shown in
Fig. 4.25(b) and ﬁnd the terminal voltage . Again . Eitherof the two approaches will give the same result. In either approach wemay assume any value of and . For example, we may use or A, or even use unspeciﬁed values of or .
It often occurs that takes a negative value. In this case, the
negative resistance ( ) implies that the circuit is supplyingpower. This is possible in a circuit with dependent sources; Example 4.10will illustrate this.
Thevenin’s theorem is very important in circuit analysis. It helps
simplify a circuit. A large circuit may be replaced by a single indepen-dent voltage source and a single resistor. This replacement techniqueis a powerful tool in circuit design.
As mentioned earlier, a linear circuit with a variable load can be
replaced by the Thevenin equivalent, exclusive of the load. The equiv-alent network behaves the same way externally as the original circuit.Consider a linear circuit terminated by a load , as shown in Fig. 4.26(a).The current through the load and the voltage across the load areeasily determined once the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit at theload’s terminals is obtained, as shown in Fig. 4.26(b). From Fig. 4.26(b),we obtain

Solution:
This circuit contains a dependent source, unlike the circuit in theprevious example. To ﬁnd we set the independent source equal tozero but leave the dependent source alone. Because of the presence ofthe dependent source, however, we excite the network with a voltagesource connected to the terminals as indicated in Fig. 4.32(a). Wemay set to ease calculation, since the circuit is linear. Ourgoal is to ﬁnd the current through the terminals, and then obtain

Answer: RTh/H110050.44 /H9024. VTh/H110055.33 V,
Determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) at
terminals a-b.
Solution:
1.Deﬁne. The problem is clearly deﬁned; we are to determine the
Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(a).
2.Present. The circuit contains a resistor in parallel with a
resistor. These are, in turn, in parallel with a dependent
current source. It is important to note that there are noindependent sources.
3.Alternative. The ﬁrst thing to consider is that, since we have no
independent sources in this circuit, we must excite the circuitexternally. In addition, when you have no independentsources you will not have a value for you will only haveto ﬁnd R
Th.VTh;4-/H90242-/H9024ale29559_ch04.qxd  07/08/2008  10:56 AM  Page 143

The simplest approach is to excite the circuit with either a
1-V voltage source or a 1-A current source. Since we will end
up with an equivalent resistance (either positive or negative), Iprefer to use the current source and nodal analysis which willyield a voltage at the output terminals equal to the resistance(with 1 A ﬂowing in, is equal to 1 times the equivalentresistance).
As an alternative, the circuit could also be excited by a 1-V
voltage source and mesh analysis could be used to ﬁnd theequivalent resistance.
4.Attempt. We start by writing the nodal equation at ain Fig. 4.35(b)
assuming 
(4.10.1)
Since we have two unknowns and only one equation, we willneed a constraint equation.
(4.10.2)
Substituting Eq. (4.10.2) into Eq. (4.10.1) yields
Since 
The negative value of the resistance tells us that, according
to the passive sign convention, the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) is
supplying power. Of course, the resistors in Fig. 4.35(a) cannotsupply power (they absorb power); it is the dependent sourcethat supplies the power. This is an example of how adependent source and resistors could be used to simulatenegative resistance.
5.Evaluate. First of all, we note that the answer has a negative
value. We know this is not possible in a passive circuit, but inthis circuit we do have an active device (the dependent currentsource). Thus, the equivalent circuit is essentially an activecircuit that can supply power.
Now we must evaluate the solution. The best way to do this
is to perform a check, using a different approach, and see if weobtain the same solution. Let us try connecting a resistor inseries with a 10-V voltage source across the output terminals ofthe original circuit and then the Thevenin equivalent. To makethe circuit easier to solve, we can take and change the parallelcurrent source and resistor to a series voltage source and
resistor by using source transformation. This, with the new
load, gives us the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(c).
We can now write two mesh equations.
Note, we only have two equations but have 3 unknowns, so weneed a constraint equation. We can use

This leads to a new equation for loop 1. Simplifying leads to
or
Substituting the ﬁrst equation into the second gives
Using the Thevenin equivalent is quite easy since we have only
one loop, as shown in Fig. 4.35(d).
6.Satisfactory? Clearly we have found the value of the equivalent
circuit as required by the problem statement.

For Practice Prob. 4.10.Norton’s Theorem
In 1926, about 43 years after Thevenin published his theorem, E. L.
Norton, an American engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, pro-posed a similar theorem.4.6
Norton’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be
replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source INin
parallel with a resistor RN, where INis the short-circuit current through
the terminals and RNis the input or equivalent resistance at the termi-
nals when the independent sources are turned off.
Thus, the circuit in Fig. 4.37(a) can be replaced by the one in Fig. 4.37(b).
The proof of Norton’s theorem will be given in the next section.
For now, we are mainly concerned with how to get and We ﬁnd
in the same way we ﬁnd In fact, from what we know about
source transformation, the Thevenin and Norton resistances are equal;
that is,
(4.9)
To ﬁnd the Norton current we determine the short-circuit current

that the short-circuit current in Fig. 4.37(b) is This must be the same
short-circuit current from terminal ato bin Fig. 4.37(a), since the two
circuits are equivalent. Thus,
(4.10)
shown in Fig. 4.38. Dependent and independent sources are treated thesame way as in Thevenin’s theorem.
Observe the close relationship between Norton’s and Thevenin’s
theorems: as in Eq. (4.9), and
(4.11)
This is essentially source transformation. For this reason, source trans-formation is often called Thevenin-Norton transformation.
Since and are related according to Eq. (4.11), to deter-
mine the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit requires that we ﬁnd:
•The open-circuit voltage across terminals aand b.
•The short-circuit current at terminals a and b.
•The equivalent or input resistance at terminals a and bwhen
all independent sources are turned off.
We can calculate any two of the three using the method that takes the
least effort and use them to get the third using Ohm’s law. Example 4.11will illustrate this. Also, since

Derivations of Thevenin’s and
Norton’s Theorems
In this section, we will prove Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems using
the superposition principle.
Consider the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a). It is assumed that the
circuit contains resistors, and dependent and independent sources. Wehave access to the circuit via terminals a and b, through which current
from an external source is applied. Our objective is to ensure that thevoltage-current relation at terminals a and bis identical to that of the
Thevenin equivalent in Fig. 4.46(b). For the sake of simplicity, sup-pose the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a) contains two independent voltagesources and and two independent current sources and Wemay obtain any circuit variable, such as the terminal voltage v, by
applying superposition. That is, we consider the contribution due toeach independent source including the external source i.By superpo-
sition, the terminal voltage v is
(4.13)
where and are constants. Each term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (4.13) is the contribution of the related independent source;that is, is the contribution to v due to the external current source i ,
is the contribution due to the voltage source and so on. We
may collect terms for the internal independent sources together as so that Eq. (4.13) becomes
(4.14)
where We now want to evalu-
ate the values of constants and When the terminals a and bare
open-circuited, and Thus, is the open-circuit voltage
which is the same as so
(4.15)
When all the internal sources are turned off, The circuit canthen be replaced by an equivalent resistance which is the same as
and Eq. (4.14) becomes
(4.16)
Substituting the values of and in Eq. (4.14) gives
(4.17)
which expresses the voltage-current relation at terminals aand bof the
circuit in Fig. 4.46(b). Thus, the two circuits in Fig. 4.46(a) and 4.46(b)are equivalent.
When the same linear circuit is driven by a voltage source vas
shown in Fig. 4.47(a), the current ﬂowing into the circuit can beobtained by superposition as

Maximum Power Transfer
In many practical situations, a circuit is designed to provide power toa load. There are applications in areas such as communications whereit is desirable to maximize the power delivered to a load. We nowaddress the problem of delivering the maximum power to a load whengiven a system with known internal losses. It should be noted that thiswill result in signiﬁcant internal losses greater than or equal to thepower delivered to the load.
The Thevenin equivalent is useful in ﬁnding the maximum power
a linear circuit can deliver to a load. We assume that we can adjust theload resistance If the entire circuit is replaced by its Theveninequivalent except for the load, as shown in Fig. 4.48, the power deliv-ered to the load is

In this section, we learn how to use PSpice to verify the theorems cov-
ered in this chapter. Speciﬁcally, we will consider using DC Sweep analy-
sis to ﬁnd the Thevenin or Norton equivalent at any pair of nodes in a
circuit and the maximum power transfer to a load. The reader is advisedto read Section D.3 of Appendix D in preparation for this section.
To ﬁnd the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit at a pair of open ter-
minals using PSpice, we use the schematic editor to draw the circuitand insert an independent probing current source, say, Ip, at the termi-nals. The probing current source must have a part name ISRC. We thenperform a DC Sweep on Ip, as discussed in Section D.3. Typically, wemay let the current through Ip vary from 0 to 1 A in 0.1-A increments.After saving and simulating the circuit, we use Probe to display a plotof the voltage across Ip versus the current through Ip. The zero inter-cept of the plot gives us the Thevenin equivalent voltage, while theslope of the plot is equal to the Thevenin resistance.
To ﬁnd the Norton equivalent involves similar steps except that we
insert a probing independent voltage source (with a part name VSRC),say, Vp, at the terminals. We perform a DC Sweep on Vp and let Vpvary from 0 to 1 V in 0.1-V increments. A plot of the current throughVp versus the voltage across Vp is obtained using the Probe menu aftersimulation. The zero intercept is equal to the Norton current, while theslope of the plot is equal to the Norton conductance.
To ﬁnd the maximum power transfer to a load using PSpice
involves performing a DC parametric Sweep on the component valueof in Fig. 4.48 and plotting the power delivered to the load as afunction of According to Fig. 4.49, the maximum power occurs R

DC Sweep. In the DC Sweep dialog box, we select Linear for theSweep Type and Current Source for the Sweep Var. Type. We enter I2
under the Name box, 0 as Start Value, 1 as End Value, and 0.1 as
Increment. After simulation, we add trace V(I2:–) from the PSpice A/D

Solution:
We need to perform a DC Sweep on to determine when the power
across it is maximum. We ﬁrst draw the circuit using Schematics asshown in Fig. 4.56. Once the circuit is drawn, we take the followingthree steps to further prepare the circuit for a DC Sweep.
The ﬁrst step involves deﬁning the value of as a parameter,
since we want to vary it. To do this:
1.DCLICKL the value 1k of R2 (representing ) to open up the
Set Attribute Value dialog box.
2. Replace 1k with {RL} and click OK to accept the change.
Note that the curly brackets are necessary.
The second step is to deﬁne parameter. To achieve this:
1. Select Draw/Get New Part/Libraries /special.slb .
2. Type PARAM in the PartName box and click OK .
3.DRAG the box to any position near the circuit.
4.CLICKL to end placement mode.
5.DCLICKL to open up the PartName: P ARAM dialog box.
6.CLICKL on NAME1 /H11005and enter RL (with no curly brackets)
in the Value box, and CLICKL Save Attr to accept change.
7.CLICKL on VALUE1 /H11005 and
CLICKL Save Attr to accept change.

The value 2k in item 7 is necessary for a bias point calculation; it
cannot be left blank.
The third step is to set up the DC Sweep to sweep the parameter.
To do this:
1. Select Analysis/Setput to bring up the DC Sweep dialog box.
2. For the Sweep Type, select Linear (or Octave for a wide range
of ).
3. For the Sweep Var. Type, select Global Parameter.
4. Under the Name box, enter RL.
5. In the Start Value box, enter 100.
6. In the End Value box, enter 5k.
7. In the Increment box, enter 100.
8. Click OK and Close to accept the parameters.
After taking these steps and saving the circuit, we are ready to
simulate. Select Analysis/Simulate. If there are no errors, we select

the Trace Command box. [The negative sign is needed since I(R2) is

Applications
In this section we will discuss two important practical applications ofthe concepts covered in this chapter: source modeling and resistancemeasurement.
4.10.1 Source Modeling
Source modeling provides an example of the usefulness of theThevenin or the Norton equivalent. An active source such as a batteryis often characterized by its Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit. Anideal voltage source provides a constant voltage irrespective of the cur-rent drawn by the load, while an ideal current source supplies a con-stant current regardless of the load voltage. As Fig. 4.58 shows,practical voltage and current sources are not ideal, due to their inter-nal resistances or source resistances and They become ideal as

of the load on voltage sources, as shown in Fig. 4.59(a). By the volt-
age division principle, the load voltage is
(4.25)
As increases, the load voltage approaches a source voltage asillustrated in Fig. 4.59(b). From Eq. (4.25), we should note that:
1. The load voltage will be constant if the internal resistance of
the source is zero or, at least, In other words, thesmaller is compared with the closer the voltage source is tobeing ideal.R

2.When the load is disconnected (i.e., the source is open-circuited so
that ), Thus, may be regarded as the unloaded
source voltage. The connection of the load causes the terminal volt-
age to drop in magnitude; this is known as the loading effect.
The same argument can be made for a practical current source whenconnected to a load as shown in Fig. 4.60(a). By the current divisionprinciple,
(4.26)
Figure 4.60(b) shows the variation in the load current as the load resist-ance increases. Again, we notice a drop in current due to the load (load-ing effect), and load current is constant (ideal current source) when theinternal resistance is very large (i.e., or, at least, ).
Sometimes, we need to know the unloaded source voltage and
the internal resistance of a voltage source. To ﬁnd and we fol-low the procedure illustrated in Fig. 4.61. First, we measure the open-circuit voltage as in Fig. 4.61(a) and set
(4.27)
Then, we connect a variable load across the terminals as in Fig. 4.61(b). We adjust the resistance until we measure a load volt-age of exactly one-half of the open-circuit voltage, because now At that point, we disconnect andmeasure it. We set

4.10.2 Resistance Measurement
Although the ohmmeter method provides the simplest way to measure
resistance, more accurate measurement may be obtained using theWheatstone bridge. While ohmmeters are designed to measure resist-ance in low, mid, or high range, a Wheatstone bridge is used to mea-sure resistance in the mid range, say, between and Very lowvalues of resistances are measured with a milliohmmeter, while very
high values are measured with a Megger tester.
The Wheatstone bridge (or resistance bridge) circuit is used in a
number of applications. Here we will use it to measure an unknownresistance. The unknown resistance is connected to the bridge asshown in Fig. 4.63. The variable resistance is adjusted until no currentﬂows through the galvanometer, which is essentially a d’Arsonvalmovement operating as a sensitive current-indicating device like anammeter in the microamp range. Under this condition and thebridge is said to be balanced. Since no current ﬂows through the gal-
vanometer, and behave as though they were in series; so do and . The fact that no current ﬂows through the galvanometer alsoimplies that Applying the voltage division principle,

1. A linear network consists of linear elements, linear dependent
sources, and linear independent sources.
2. Network theorems are used to reduce a complex circuit to a sim-
pler one, thereby making circuit analysis much simpler.
3. The superposition principle states that for a circuit having multi-
ple independent sources, the voltage across (or current through) an
element is equal to the algebraic sum of all the individual voltages(or currents) due to each independent source acting one at a time.
4. Source transformation is a procedure for transforming a voltage
source in series with a resistor to a current source in parallel witha resistor, or vice versa.
5. Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems allow us to isolate a portion of
a network while the remaining portion of the network is replacedby an equivalent network. The Thevenin equivalent consists of avoltage source in series with a resistor while the Nortonequivalent consists of a current source in parallel with a resis-tor The two theorems are related by source transformation.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Electronic Instrumentation
Engineering involves applying physical principles to design devices for
the beneﬁt of humanity. But physical principles cannot be understoodwithout measurement. In fact, physicists often say that physics is thescience that measures reality. Just as measurements are a tool for under-standing the physical world, instruments are tools for measurement.The operational ampliﬁer introduced in this chapter is a building blockof modern electronic instrumentation. Therefore, mastery of operationalampliﬁer fundamentals is paramount to any practical application ofelectronic circuits.
Electronic instruments are used in all ﬁelds of science and engi-
neering. They have proliferated in science and technology to the extentthat it would be ridiculous to have a scientiﬁc or technical educationwithout exposure to electronic instruments. For example, physicists,physiologists, chemists, and biologists must learn to use electronicinstruments. For electrical engineering students in particular, the skillin operating digital and analog electronic instruments is crucial. Suchinstruments include ammeters, voltmeters, ohmmeters, oscilloscopes,spectrum analyzers, and signal generators.
Beyond developing the skill for operating the instruments, some
electrical engineers specialize in designing and constructing electronicinstruments. These engineers derive pleasure in building their owninstruments. Most of them invent and patent their inventions. Special-ists in electronic instruments ﬁnd employment in medical schools, hos-pitals, research laboratories, aircraft industries, and thousands of otherindustries where electronic instruments are routinely used.

Introduction
Having learned the basic laws and theorems for circuit analysis, we are
now ready to study an active circuit element of paramount importance:the operational ampliﬁer , or op amp for short. The op amp is a versa-
tile circuit building block.
The op amp is an electronic unit that behaves like a voltage-controlled
voltage source.
It can also be used in making a voltage- or current-controlled currentsource. An op amp can sum signals, amplify a signal, integrate it, ordifferentiate it. The ability of the op amp to perform these mathemat-ical operations is the reason it is called an operational ampliﬁer. It is
also the reason for the widespread use of op amps in analog design.Op amps are popular in practical circuit designs because they are ver-satile, inexpensive, easy to use, and fun to work with.
We begin by discussing the ideal op amp and later consider the
nonideal op amp. Using nodal analysis as a tool, we consider ideal opamp circuits such as the inverter, voltage follower, summer, and dif-ference ampliﬁer. We will also analyze op amp circuits with PSpice.
Finally, we learn how an op amp is used in digital-to-analog convert-ers and instrumentation ampliﬁers.
Operational Ampliﬁers
An operational ampliﬁer is designed so that it performs some mathe-matical operations when external components, such as resistors andcapacitors, are connected to its terminals. Thus, 
An op amp is an active circuit element designed to perform mathe-
matical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, dif-
ferentiation, and integration.
The op amp is an electronic device consisting of a complex
arrangement of resistors, transistors, capacitors, and diodes. A full dis-
cussion of what is inside the op amp is beyond the scope of this book.It will sufﬁce to treat the op amp as a circuit building block and sim-ply study what takes place at its terminals.
Op amps are commercially available in integrated circuit packages
in several forms. Figure 5.1 shows a typical op amp package. A typicalone is the eight-pin dual in-line package (or DIP), shown in Fig. 5.2(a).Pin or terminal 8 is unused, and terminals 1 and 5 are of little concernto us. The ﬁve important terminals are:
1. The inverting input, pin 2.2. The noninverting input, pin 3.3. The output, pin 6.4. The positive power supply V
/H11001, pin 7.
5. The negative power supply V/H11002, pin 4.
The circuit symbol for the op amp is the triangle in Fig. 5.2(b); asshown, the op amp has two inputs and one output. The inputs are5.25.1176 Chapter 5 Operational Ampliﬁers
The pin diagram in Fig. 5.2(a)
corresponds to the 741 general-purpose op amp made by FairchildSemiconductor.
Figure 5.1

Courtesy of Tech America.An op amp may also be regarded as a
voltage ampliﬁer with very high gain.The term operational ampliﬁer was in-
troduced in 1947 by John Ragazziniand his colleagues, in their work onanalog computers for the NationalDefense Research Council after WorldWar II. The ﬁrst op amps used vacuum
tubes rather than transistors.ale29559_ch05.qxd  07/16/2008  05:19 PM  Page 176

marked with minus (/H11002) and plus (/H11001) to specify inverting and nonin-
verting inputs, respectively. An input applied to the noninverting ter-
minal will appear with the same polarity at the output, while an input
applied to the inverting terminal will appear inverted at the output.
As an active element, the op amp must be powered by a voltage
supply as typically shown in Fig. 5.3. Although the power supplies areoften ignored in op amp circuit diagrams for the sake of simplicity, thepower supply currents must not be overlooked. By KCL,
(5.1)
The equivalent circuit model of an op amp is shown in Fig. 5.4.
The output section consists of a voltage-controlled source in series withthe output resistance R
o. It is evident from Fig. 5.4 that the input resis-
tance Riis the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen at the input termi-
nals, while the output resistance Rois the Thevenin equivalent resistance
seen at the output. The differential input voltage vdis given by
(5.2)
where v1is the voltage between the inverting terminal and ground and
v2is the voltage between the noninverting terminal and ground. The
op amp senses the difference between the two inputs, multiplies it bythe gain A, and causes the resulting voltage to appear at the output.Thus, the output v
ois given by
(5.3)
Ais called the open-loop voltage gain because it is the gain of the op
amp without any external feedback from output to input. Table 5.1vo/H11005Avd/H11005A(v 2/H11002v1)vd/H11005v2/H11002v1io/H11005i1/H11001i2/H11001i/H11001/H11001i/H110025.2 Operational Ampliﬁers 177

shows typical values of voltage gain A, input resistance Ri, output
resistance Ro, and supply voltage VCC.
The concept of feedback is crucial to our understanding of op amp
circuits. A negative feedback is achieved when the output is fed back
to the inverting terminal of the op amp. As Example 5.1 shows, whenthere is a feedback path from output to input, the ratio of the outputvoltage to the input voltage is called the closed-loop gain. As a result
of the negative feedback, it can be shown that the closed-loop gain isalmost insensitive to the open-loop gain Aof the op amp. For this rea-
son, op amps are used in circuits with feedback paths.
Apractical limitation of the op amp is that the magnitude of its
output voltage cannot exceed | V
CC|. In other words, the output voltage
is dependent on and is limited by the power supply voltage. Figure 5.5illustrates that the op amp can operate in three modes, depending onthe differential input voltage v
d:
1. Positive saturation, v o/H11005VCC.
2. Linear region, /H11002V CC/H11349vo/H11005Avd/H11349VCC.
3. Negative saturation, v o/H11005/H11002 VCC.
If we attempt to increase vdbeyond the linear range, the op amp
becomes saturated and yields vo/H11005VCCor vo/H11005/H11002 VCC. Throughout
this book, we will assume that our op amps operate in the linear mode.This means that the output voltage is restricted by
(5.4)
Although we shall always operate the op amp in the linear region, thepossibility of saturation must be borne in mind when one designs withop amps, to avoid designing op amp circuits that will not work in thelaboratory./H11002V

For Practice Prob. 5.1.Ideal Op Amp
To facilitate the understanding of op amp circuits, we will assume ideal
op amps. An op amp is ideal if it has the following characteristics:
1. Inﬁnite open-loop gain, 
2. Inﬁnite input resistance, 3. Zero output resistance, R
o/H112290.Ri/H11229/H11009.A/H11229/H11009.5.3ale29559_ch05.qxd  07/16/2008  05:19 PM  Page 179

An ideal op amp is an ampliﬁer with inﬁnite open-loop gain, inﬁnite
input resistance, and zero output resistance.
Although assuming an ideal op amp provides only an approxi-
mate analysis, most modern amplifiers have such large gains and
input impedances that the approximate analysis is a good one. Unlessstated otherwise, we will assume from now on that every op amp isideal.
For circuit analysis, the ideal op amp is illustrated in Fig. 5.8,
which is derived from the nonideal model in Fig. 5.4. Two importantcharacteristics of the ideal op amp are:
1. The currents into both input terminals are zero:
(5.5)
This is due to inﬁnite input resistance. An inﬁnite resistancebetween the input terminals implies that an open circuit exists thereand current cannot enter the op amp. But the output current is notnecessarily zero according to Eq. (5.1).
2. The voltage across the input terminals is equal to zero; i.e.,
(5.6)
or
(5.7)
Thus, an ideal op amp has zero current into its two input ter-minals and the voltage between the two input terminals is equalto zero. Equations (5.5) and (5.7) are extremely importantand should be regarded as the key handles to analyzing op ampcircuits.v

The two characteristics can be ex-

Example 5.2 Rework Practice Prob. 5.1 using the ideal op amp model.
Solution:
We may replace the op amp in Fig. 5.7 by its equivalent model in
Fig. 5.9 as we did in Example 5.1. But we do not really need to dothis. We just need to keep Eqs. (5.5) and (5.7) in mind as we analyzethe circuit in Fig. 5.7. Thus, the Fig. 5.7 circuit is presented as inFig. 5.9. Notice that
(5.2.1)
Since i
1/H110050, the 40-k/H9024 and 5-k/H9024 resistors are in series; the same
current ﬂows through them. v1is the voltage across the 5-k /H9024 resistor.

According to Eq. (5.7),
(5.2.3)
Substituting Eqs. (5.2.1) and (5.2.2) into Eq. (5.2.3) yields the closed-
loop gain,
(5.2.4)
which is very close to the value of 9.00041 obtained with the nonidealmodel in Practice Prob. 5.1. This shows that negligibly small errorresults from assuming ideal op amp characteristics.

In this and the following sections, we consider some useful op amp
circuits that often serve as modules for designing more complex cir-cuits. The ﬁrst of such op amp circuits is the inverting ampliﬁer shownin Fig. 5.10. In this circuit, the noninverting input is grounded, v

connected to the inverting input through R1, and the feedback resistor
Rfis connected between the inverting input and output. Our goal is to
obtain the relationship between the input voltage v iand the output volt-
age vo. Applying KCL at node 1,

A key feature of the inverting ampliﬁer
is that both the input signal and thefeedback are applied at the invertingterminal of the op amp.ale29559_ch05.qxd  07/16/2008  05:19 PM  Page 181

The voltage gain is A v/H11005vo/H20862vi/H11005/H11002 Rf/H20862R1. The designation of the cir-
cuit in Fig. 5.10 as an inverter arises from the negative sign. Thus,
An inverting ampliﬁer reverses the polarity of the input signal while
amplifying it.
Notice that the gain is the feedback resistance divided by the
input resistance which means that the gain depends only on the
external elements connected to the op amp. In view of Eq. (5.9), anequivalent circuit for the inverting ampliﬁer is shown in Fig. 5.11.The inverting ampliﬁer is used, for example, in a current-to-voltageconverter.v

(5.11)
The voltage gain is A v/H11005vo/H20862vi/H110051/H11001Rf/H20862R1, which does not have a
negative sign. Thus, the output has the same polarity as the input.
A noninverting ampliﬁer is an op amp circuit designed to provide a
positive voltage gain.
Again we notice that the gain depends only on the external resistors.
Notice that if feedback resistor Rf/H110050 (short circuit) or R 1/H11005/H11009
(open circuit) or both, the gain becomes 1. Under these conditions
(Rf/H110050 and R 1/H11005/H11009 ), the circuit in Fig. 5.16 becomes that shown
in Fig. 5.17, which is called a voltage follower (or unity gain
ampliﬁer) because the output follows the input. Thus, for a voltagefollower
(5.12)
Such a circuit has a very high input impedance and is therefore use-ful as an intermediate-stage (or buffer) ampliﬁer to isolate one circuitfrom another, as portrayed in Fig. 5.18. The voltage follower mini-mizes interaction between the two stages and eliminates interstageloading.v

Besides ampliﬁcation, the op amp can perform addition and subtrac-
tion. The addition is performed by the summing ampliﬁer covered inthis section; the subtraction is performed by the difference ampliﬁercovered in the next section.
A summing ampliﬁer is an op amp circuit that combines several inputs
and produces an output that is the weighted sum of the inputs.
The summing ampliﬁer, shown in Fig. 5.21, is a variation of the
inverting ampliﬁer. It takes advantage of the fact that the inverting con-
ﬁguration can handle many inputs at the same time. We keep in mind5.6

Difference Ampliﬁer
Difference (or differential) ampliﬁers are used in various applications
where there is need to amplify the difference between two input sig-nals. They are ﬁrst cousins of the instrumentation ampliﬁer, the most
useful and popular ampliﬁer, which we will discuss in Section 5.10.
A difference ampliﬁer is a device that ampliﬁes the difference between
two inputs but rejects any signals common to the two inputs.

zero currents enter the op amp terminals. Applying KCL to node a,

Cascaded Op Amp Circuits
As we know, op amp circuits are modules or building blocks for
designing complex circuits. It is often necessary in practical applica-tions to connect op amp circuits in cascade (i.e., head to tail) to achievea large overall gain. In general, two circuits are cascaded when theyare connected in tandem, one behind another in a single ﬁle.
A cascade connection is a head-to-tail arrangement of two or more op
amp circuits such that the output of one is the input of the next.
When op amp circuits are cascaded, each circuit in the string is
called a stage; the original input signal is increased by the gain of the
individual stage. Op amp circuits have the advantage that they can be
cascaded without changing their input-output relationships. This is due tothe fact that each (ideal) op amp circuit has inﬁnite input resistance andzero output resistance. Figure 5.28 displays a block diagram represen-tation of three op amp circuits in cascade. Since the output of one stageis the input to the next stage, the overall gain of the cascade connectionis the product of the gains of the individual op amp circuits, or
(5.22)
Although the cascade connection does not affect the op amp input-output relationships, care must be exercised in the design of an actualop amp circuit to ensure that the load due to the next stage in the cas-cade does not saturate the op amp.A/H11005A

different techniques (the ﬁrst is to treat the op amp circuits as
just gains and a summer and the second is to use circuit analysiswith PSpice). This is a very good method of assuring that we
have the correct answer.

Op Amp Circuit Analysis with PSpice
PSpice for Windows does not have a model for an ideal op amp, although
one may create one as a subcircuit using the Create Subcircuit line in
the Tools menu. Rather than creating an ideal op amp, we will use one
of the four nonideal, commercially available op amps supplied in the
PSpice library eval.slb. The op amp models have the part names LF411,
LM111, LM324, and uA741, as shown in Fig. 5.34. Each of them canbe obtained from Draw/Get New Part/libraries . . ./eval.lib or by sim-
ply selecting Draw/Get New Part and typing the part name in the
PartName dialog box, as usual. Note that each of them requires dc sup-
plies, without which the op amp will not work. The dc supplies shouldbe connected as shown in Fig. 5.3.5.9194 Chapter 5 Operational Ampliﬁers

Applications
The op amp is a fundamental building block in modern electronic
instrumentation. It is used extensively in many devices, along withresistors and other passive elements. Its numerous practical applicationsinclude instrumentation ampliﬁers, digital-to-analog converters, analogcomputers, level shifters, ﬁlters, calibration circuits, inverters, sum-mers, integrators, differentiators, subtractors, logarithmic ampliﬁers,comparators, gyrators, oscillators, rectiﬁers, regulators, voltage-to-current converters, current-to-voltage converters, and clippers. Some ofthese we have already considered. We will consider two more applica-tions here: the digital-to-analog converter and the instrumentationampliﬁer.
5.10.1 Digital-to-Analog Converter
The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) transforms digital signals intoanalog form. A typical example of a four-bit DAC is illustrated inFig. 5.36(a). The four-bit DAC can be realized in many ways. A sim-ple realization is the binary weighted ladder , shown in Fig. 5.36(b).
The bits are weights according to the magnitude of their place value,by descending value of R
f/H20862Rnso that each lesser bit has half the
weight of the next higher. This is obviously an inverting summingampliﬁer. The output is related to the inputs as shown in Eq. (5.15).Thus,
(5.23)
Input V
1is called the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB), while input V 4is the
least signiﬁcant bit (LSB). Each of the four binary inputs V1, . . . , V 4
can assume only two voltage levels: 0 or 1 V . By using the proper inputand feedback resistor values, the DAC provides a single output that isproportional to the inputs./H11002V

R2/H1100520 k/H9024, R3/H1100540 k/H9024, and R 4/H1100580 k/H9024. Obtain the analog output
for binary inputs [0000], [0001], [0010] ,...,  [ 1111].
Solution:
Substituting the given values of the input and feedback resistors inEq. (5.23) gives
Using this equation, a digital input [ V
1V2V3V4] /H11005[0000] produces an ana-
log output of /H11002 Vo/H110050 V; [V 1V2V3V4] /H11005[0001] gives /H11002 Vo/H110050.125 V . /H11005V1/H110010.5V 2/H110010.25V 3/H110010.125V 4 /H11002V o/H11005Rf

Similarly,
Table 5.2 summarizes the result of the digital-to-analog conversion.
Note that we have assumed that each bit has a value of 0.125 V . Thus,
in this system, we cannot represent a voltage between 1.000 and 1.125,for example. This lack of resolution is a major limitation of digital-to-analog conversions. For greater accuracy, a word representation with agreater number of bits is required. Even then a digital representationof an analog voltage is never exact. In spite of this inexact represen-tation, digital representation has been used to accomplish remarkablethings such as audio CDs and digital photography. /H110051.875 V 3V

5.10.2 Instrumentation Ampliﬁers
One of the most useful and versatile op amp circuits for precision
measurement and process control is the instrumentation ampliﬁer (IA),
so called because of its widespread use in measurement systems. Typ-ical applications of IAs include isolation ampliﬁers, thermocoupleampliﬁers, and data acquisition systems.
The instrumentation ampliﬁer is an extension of the difference
ampliﬁer in that it ampliﬁes the difference between its input signals.As shown in Fig. 5.26 (see Example 5.8), an instrumentation ampliﬁertypically consists of three op amps and seven resistors. For conven-ience, the ampliﬁer is shown again in Fig. 5.38(a), where the resistors aremade equal except for the external gain-setting resistor R
G, connected
between the gain set terminals. Figure 5.38(b) shows its schematicsymbol. Example 5.8 showed that

voltages. Since the common-mode voltages are equal, they cancel each
other.
The IA has three major characteristics:
1. The voltage gain is adjusted by oneexternal resistor R G.
2. The input impedance of both inputs is very high and does not vary
as the gain is adjusted.
3. The output vodepends on the difference between the inputs v 1
and v2, not on the voltage common to them (common-mode
voltage).
Due to the widespread use of IAs, manufacturers have developed
these ampliﬁers on single-package units. A typical example is the
LH0036, developed by National Semiconductor. The gain can be var-ied from 1 to 1,000 by an external resistor whose value may vary from100 /H9024to 10 k/H9024.5.11 Summary 199
Example 5.13 In Fig. 5.38, let R/H1100510 k/H9024 , v1/H110052.011 V , and v2/H110052.017 V . If RG
is adjusted to 500 /H9024 , determine: (a) the voltage gain, (b) the output
voltage vo.

Answer: 354.6 /H9024.
Summary
1. The op amp is a high-gain ampliﬁer that has high input resistance
and low output resistance.
2. Table 5.3 summarizes the op amp circuits considered in this chap-
ter. The expression for the gain of each ampliﬁer circuit holds
whether the inputs are dc, ac, or time-varying in general.5.11ale29559_ch05.qxd  07/16/2008  05:19 PM  Page 199

3. An ideal op amp has an inﬁnite input resistance, a zero output
resistance, and an inﬁnite gain.
4. For an ideal op amp, the current into each of its two input termi-
nals is zero, and the voltage across its input terminals is negligi-
bly small.
5. In an inverting ampliﬁer, the output voltage is a negative multiple
of the input.
6. In a noninverting ampliﬁer, the output is a positive multiple of the
input.
7. In a voltage follower, the output follows the input.8. In a summing ampliﬁer, the output is the weighted sum of the
inputs.
9. In a difference ampliﬁer, the output is proportional to the differ-
ence of the two inputs.
10. Op amp circuits may be cascaded without changing their input-
output relationships.
11.PSpice can be used to analyze an op amp circuit.
12. Typical applications of the op amp considered in this chapter include
the digital-to-analog converter and the instrumentation ampliﬁer.200 Chapter 5 Operational Ampliﬁers

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.c), “an ability to design a system,
component, or process to meet desired needs.”
The “ability to design a system, component, or process to meetdesired needs” is why engineers are hired. That is why this is themost important technical skill that an engineer has. Interestingly, your
success as an engineer is directly proportional to your ability to com-municate but your being able to design is why you will be hired inthe ﬁrst place.
Design takes place when you have what is termed an open-ended
problem that eventually is deﬁned by the solution. Within the contextof this course or textbook, we can only explore some of the elementsof design. Pursuing all of the steps of our problem-solving techniqueteaches you several of the most important elements of the designprocess.
Probably the most important part of design is clearly deﬁning what
the system, component, process, or, in our case, problem is. Rarely isan engineer given a perfectly clear assignment. Therefore, as a student,you can develop and enhance this skill by asking yourself, your col-leagues, or your professors questions designed to clarify the problemstatement.
Exploring alternative solutions is another important part of the
design process. Again, as a student, you can practice this part of thedesign process on almost every problem you work.
Evaluating your solutions is critical to any engineering assignment.
Again, this is a skill that you as a student can practice on every prob-lem you work.

Introduction
So far we have limited our study to resistive circuits. In this chapter,
we shall introduce two new and important passive linear circuit ele-ments: the capacitor and the inductor. Unlike resistors, which dissipateenergy, capacitors and inductors do not dissipate but store energy,which can be retrieved at a later time. For this reason, capacitors andinductors are called storage elements.
The application of resistive circuits is quite limited. With the intro-
duction of capacitors and inductors in this chapter, we will be able toanalyze more important and practical circuits. Be assured that the cir-cuit analysis techniques covered in Chapters 3 and 4 are equally appli-cable to circuits with capacitors and inductors.
We begin by introducing capacitors and describing how to com-
bine them in series or in parallel. Later, we do the same for inductors.As typical applications, we explore how capacitors are combined withop amps to form integrators, differentiators, and analog computers.
Capacitors
Acapacitor is a passive element designed to store energy in its elec-
tric ﬁeld. Besides resistors, capacitors are the most common electricalcomponents. Capacitors are used extensively in electronics, communi-cations, computers, and power systems. For example, they are used inthe tuning circuits of radio receivers and as dynamic memory elementsin computer systems.
Acapacitor is typically constructed as depicted in Fig. 6.1.6.26.1216 Chapter 6 Capacitors and Inductors
In contrast to a resistor, which spends
or dissipates energy irreversibly, aninductor or capacitor stores or releasesenergy (i.e., has a memory).

Alternatively, capacitance is the amount
of charge stored per plate for a unitvoltage difference in a capacitor.A capacitor consists of two conducting plates separated by an insu-
lator (or dielectric).
In many practical applications, the plates may be aluminum foil while
the dielectric may be air, ceramic, paper, or mica.
When a voltage source is connected to the capacitor, as in
Fig. 6.2, the source deposits a positive charge qon one plate and a neg-
ative charge on the other. The capacitor is said to store the electriccharge. The amount of charge stored, represented by q, is directly pro-
portional to the applied voltage so that
(6.1)
where C, the constant of proportionality, is known as the capacitance
of the capacitor. The unit of capacitance is the farad (F), in honor ofthe English physicist Michael Faraday (1791–1867). From Eq. (6.1),we may derive the following deﬁnition.q/H11005Cvv/H11002qv
Capacitance is the ratio of the charge on one plate of a capacitor to
the voltage difference between the two plates, measured in farads (F).
Note from Eq. (6.1) that 1 farad /H110051 coulomb/volt.ale29559_ch06.qxd  07/08/2008  10:59 AM  Page 216

Although the capacitance Cof a capacitor is the ratio of the charge
qper plate to the applied voltage it does not depend on qor It
depends on the physical dimensions of the capacitor. For example, for
the parallel-plate capacitor shown in Fig. 6.1, the capacitance is given by
(6.2)
where Ais the surface area of each plate, dis the distance between
the plates, and is the permittivity of the dielectric material betweenthe plates. Although Eq. (6.2) applies to only parallel-plate capacitors,we may infer from it that, in general, three factors determine the valueof the capacitance:
1. The surface area of the plates—the larger the area, the greater the
capacitance.
2.The spacing between the plates—the smaller the spacing, the greaterthe capacitance.
3. The permittivity of the material—the higher the permittivity, the
greater the capacitance.
Capacitors are commercially available in different values and types.
Typically, capacitors have values in the picofarad (pF) to microfarad 
range. They are described by the dielectric material they are made of and
by whether they are of ﬁxed or variable type. Figure 6.3 shows the cir-cuit symbols for ﬁxed and variable capacitors. Note that according to thepassive sign convention, if and or if and thecapacitor is being charged, and if the capacitor is discharging.
Figure 6.4 shows common types of ﬁxed-value capacitors. Poly-
ester capacitors are light in weight, stable, and their change with tem-perature is predictable. Instead of polyester, other dielectric materialssuch as mica and polystyrene may be used. Film capacitors are rolledand housed in metal or plastic ﬁlms. Electrolytic capacitors producevery high capacitance. Figure 6.5 shows the most common types ofvariable capacitors.

Michael Faraday (1791–1867), an English chemist and physicist,
was probably the greatest experimentalist who ever lived.
Born near London, Faraday realized his boyhood dream by work-
ing with the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institu-
tion, where he worked for 54 years. He made several contributionsin all areas of physical science and coined such words as electroly-sis, anode, and cathode. His discovery of electromagnetic inductionin 1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering because it provideda way of generating electricity. The electric motor and generator oper-ate on this principle. The unit of capacitance, the farad, was namedin his honor.Historical
Capacitor voltage rating and capaci-
tance are typically inversely rated dueto the relationships in Eqs. (6.1) and(6.2). Arcing occurs if 
dis small and V
is high.

is often placed in parallel with another capacitor so that the equivalent
capacitance can be varied slightly. The capacitance of the variable aircapacitor (meshed plates) is varied by turning the shaft. Variable capac-itors are used in radio receivers allowing one to tune to various sta-tions. In addition, capacitors are used to block dc, pass ac, shift phase,store energy, start motors, and suppress noise.
To obtain the current-voltage relationship of the capacitor, we take
the derivative of both sides of Eq. (6.1). Since
(6.3)
differentiating both sides of Eq. (6.1) gives
(6.4)
This is the current-voltage relationship for a capacitor, assuming thepassive sign convention. The relationship is illustrated in Fig. 6.6 fora capacitor whose capacitance is independent of voltage. Capacitorsthat satisfy Eq. (6.4) are said to be linear. For a nonlinear capacitor,
the plot of the current-voltage relationship is not a straight line.Although some capacitors are nonlinear, most are linear. We willassume linear capacitors in this book.
The voltage-current relation of the capacitor can be obtained by
integrating both sides of Eq. (6.4). We get

Equation (6.9) or (6.10) represents the energy stored in the electric ﬁeldthat exists between the plates of the capacitor. This energy can beretrieved, since an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy. In fact, theword capacitor is derived from this element’s capacity to store energy
in an electric ﬁeld.
We should note the following important properties of a capacitor:
1. Note from Eq. (6.4) that when the voltage across a capacitor is not
changing with time (i.e., dc voltage), the current through the capac-itor is zero. Thus,w/H11005q

A capacitor is an open circuit to dc.
However, if a battery (dc voltage) is connected across a capacitor,
the capacitor charges.
2. The voltage on the capacitor must be continuous.
The voltage on a capacitor cannot change abruptly.
The capacitor resists an abrupt change in the voltage across it.
According to Eq. (6.4), a discontinuous change in voltage requiresan inﬁnite current, which is physically impossible. For example,the voltage across a capacitor may take the form shown inFig. 6.7(a), whereas it is not physically possible for the capacitorvoltage to take the form shown in Fig. 6.7(b) because of the abruptchanges. Conversely, the current through a capacitor can changeinstantaneously.
3. The ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. It takes power from
the circuit when storing energy in its ﬁeld and returns previouslystored energy when delivering power to the circuit.
4. A real, nonideal capacitor has a parallel-model leakage resistance,
as shown in Fig. 6.8. The leakage resistance may be as high asv

An alternative way of looking at this is
using Eq. (6.9), which indicates thatenergy is proportional to voltagesquared. Since injecting or extractingenergy can only be done over someﬁnite time, voltage cannot changeinstantaneously across a capacitor.

Inductors
An inductor is a passive element designed to store energy in its mag-
netic ﬁeld. Inductors ﬁnd numerous applications in electronic andpower systems. They are used in power supplies, transformers, radios,TVs, radars, and electric motors.
Any conductor of electric current has inductive properties and may
be regarded as an inductor. But in order to enhance the inductive effect,a practical inductor is usually formed into a cylindrical coil with manyturns of conducting wire, as shown in Fig. 6.21.6.4226 Chapter 6 Capacitors and Inductors
An inductor consists of a coil of conducting wire.
If current is allowed to pass through an inductor, it is found that the
voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to the time rate ofchange of the current. Using the passive sign convention,
(6.18)
where Lis the constant of proportionality called the inductance of the
inductor. The unit of inductance is the henry (H), named in honor ofthe American inventor Joseph Henry (1797–1878). It is clear fromEq. (6.18) that 1 henry equals 1 volt-second per ampere.v/H11005L

In view of Eq. (6.18), for an inductor
to have voltage across its terminals, itscurrent must vary with time. Hence,

the inductor.
Inductance is the property whereby an inductor exhibits opposition
to the change of current ﬂowing through it, measured in henrys (H).
The inductance of an inductor depends on its physical dimension
and construction. Formulas for calculating the inductance of inductors
of different shapes are derived from electromagnetic theory and can befound in standard electrical engineering handbooks. For example, forthe inductor, (solenoid) shown in Fig. 6.21,
(6.19)
where Nis the number of turns, is the length, Ais the cross-sectional
area, and is the permeability of the core. We can see from Eq. (6.19)that inductance can be increased by increasing the number of turns ofcoil, using material with higher permeability as the core, increasing thecross-sectional area, or reducing the length of the coil.
Like capacitors, commercially available inductors come in differ-
ent values and types. Typical practical inductors have inductance valuesranging from a few microhenrys ( ), as in communication systems,to tens of henrys (H) as in power systems. Inductors may be ﬁxed orvariable. The core may be made of iron, steel, plastic, or air. The termscoil and choke are also used for inductors. Common inductors are
shown in Fig. 6.22. The circuit symbols for inductors are shown inFig. 6.23, following the passive sign convention.
Equation (6.18) is the voltage-current relationship for an inductor.

inductance is independent of current. Such an inductor is known as a
linear inductor. For a nonlinear inductor, the plot of Eq. (6.18) will
not be a straight line because its inductance varies with current. Wewill assume linear inductors in this textbook unless stated otherwise.

Joseph Henry (1797–1878), an American physicist, discovered induc-
tance and constructed an electric motor.
Born in Albany, New York, Henry graduated from Albany Acad-
emy and taught philosophy at Princeton University from 1832 to 1846.
He was the ﬁrst secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He conducted
several experiments on electromagnetism and developed powerful elec-tromagnets that could lift objects weighing thousands of pounds. Inter-estingly, Joseph Henry discovered electromagnetic induction beforeFaraday but failed to publish his ﬁndings. The unit of inductance, thehenry, was named after him.Historical

Since 
(6.24)
We should note the following important properties of an inductor.
1. Note from Eq. (6.18) that the voltage across an inductor is zero
when the current is constant. Thus,w/H110051
2 Li2i  (/H11002/H11009) /H110050,228 Chapter 6 Capacitors and Inductors
An inductor acts like a short circuit to dc.
2.An important property of the inductor is its opposition to the
change in current ﬂowing through it.
The current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously.
According to Eq. (6.18), a discontinuous change in the current
through an inductor requires an inﬁnite voltage, which is not phys-ically possible. Thus, an inductor opposes an abrupt change in thecurrent through it. For example, the current through an inductormay take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(a), whereas the inductor cur-rent cannot take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(b) in real-life situa-tions due to the discontinuities. However, the voltage across aninductor can change abruptly.
3.Like the ideal capacitor, the ideal inductor does not dissipateenergy. The energy stored in it can be retrieved at a later time. Theinductor takes power from the circuit when storing energy anddelivers power to the circuit when returning previously storedenergy.
4. A practical, nonideal inductor has a signiﬁcant resistive component,
as shown in Fig. 6.26. This is due to the fact that the inductor ismade of a conducting material such as copper, which has someresistance. This resistance is called the winding resistance , and
it appears in series with the inductance of the inductor. The pres-ence of makes it both an energy storage device and an energydissipation device. Since is usually very small, it is ignored inmost cases. The nonideal inductor also has a winding capacitance
due to the capacitive coupling between the conducting coils. 
is very small and can be ignored in most cases, except at high fre-quencies. We will assume ideal inductors in this book.C

The equivalent inductance of series-connected inductors is the sum
of the individual inductances.
Inductors in series are combined in exactly the same way as resistors
in series.
We now consider a parallel connection of N inductors, as shown
in Fig. 6.30(a), with the equivalent circuit in Fig. 6.30(b). The induc-tors have the same voltage across them. Using KCL,

The equivalent inductance of parallel inductors is the reciprocal of the
sum of the reciprocals of the individual inductances.
Note that the inductors in parallel are combined in the same way as
resistors in parallel.
For two inductors in parallel , Eq. (6.30) becomes

come in discrete form and tend to be more bulky and expensive. For
this reason, inductors are not as versatile as capacitors and resistors,and they are more limited in applications. However, there are severalapplications in which inductors have no practical substitute. They areroutinely used in relays, delays, sensing devices, pick-up heads, tele-phone circuits, radio and TV receivers, power supplies, electric motors,microphones, and loudspeakers, to mention a few.
Capacitors and inductors possess the following three special prop-
erties that make them very useful in electric circuits:
1.The capacity to store energy makes them useful as temporary volt-age or current sources. Thus, they can be used for generating a largeamount of current or voltage for a short period of time.
2. Capacitors oppose any abrupt change in voltage, while inductors
oppose any abrupt change in current. This property makes induc-tors useful for spark or arc suppression and for converting pulsat-ing dc voltage into relatively smooth dc voltage.
3.Capacitors and inductors are frequency sensitive. This propertymakes them useful for frequency discrimination.
The ﬁrst two properties are put to use in dc circuits, while the thirdone is taken advantage of in ac circuits. We will see how useful theseproperties are in later chapters. For now, consider three applicationsinvolving capacitors and op amps: integrator, differentiator, and analogcomputer.
6.6.1 Integrator
Important op amp circuits that use energy-storage elements includeintegrators and differentiators. These op amp circuits often involveresistors and capacitors; inductors (coils) tend to be more bulky andexpensive.
The op amp integrator is used in numerous applications, especially
in analog computers, to be discussed in Section 6.6.3.234 Chapter 6 Capacitors and Inductors
An integrator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to the
integral of the input signal.
If the feedback resistor in the familiar inverting ampliﬁer of
Fig. 6.35(a) is replaced by a capacitor, we obtain an ideal integrator,
as shown in Fig. 6.35(b). It is interesting that we can obtain a mathe-matical representation of integration this way. At node ain Fig. 6.35(b),

6.6.2 Differentiator
A differentiator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to
the rate of change of the input signal.
In Fig. 6.35(a), if the input resistor is replaced by a capacitor, the
resulting circuit is a differentiator, shown in Fig. 6.37. Applying KCL
at node a,
(6.36) iR/H11005iCThe integrator in Fig. 6.35(b) has , Determine
the output voltage when a dc voltage of 10 mV is applied at Assume that the op amp is initially nulled.

But
Substituting these in Eq. (6.36) yields
(6.37)
showing that the output is the derivative of the input. Differentiator cir-
cuits are electronically unstable because any electrical noise within thecircuit is exaggerated by the differentiator. For this reason, the differ-entiator circuit in Fig. 6.37 is not as useful and popular as the inte-grator. It is seldom used in practice.v

6.6.3 Analog Computer
Op amps were initially developed for electronic analog computers.
Analog computers can be programmed to solve mathematical models ofmechanical or electrical systems. These models are usually expressed interms of differential equations.
To solve simple differential equations using the analog computer
requires cascading three types of op amp circuits: integrator circuits,summing ampliﬁers, and inverting/noninverting ampliﬁers for negative/positive scaling. The best way to illustrate how an analog computer solvesa differential equation is with an example.
Suppose we desire the solution of the equation
(6.38)
where a, b, and c are constants, and is an arbitrary forcing func-
tion. The solution is obtained by ﬁrst solving the highest-order deriv-ative term. Solving for yields
(6.39)
To obtain , the term is integrated and inverted. Finally,
to obtain x, the term is integrated and inverted. The forcing func-
tion is injected at the proper point. Thus, the analog computer for solv-ing Eq. (6.38) is implemented by connecting the necessary summers,inverters, and integrators. A plotter or oscilloscope may be used to viewthe output x, or or depending on where it is connected
in the system.
Although the above example is on a second-order differential equa-
tion, any differential equation can be simulated by an analog computercomprising integrators, inverters, and inverting summers. But care mustbe exercised in selecting the values of the resistors and capacitors, toensure that the op amps do not saturate during the solution time interval.
The analog computers with vacuum tubes were built in the 1950s and
1960s. Recently their use has declined. They have been superseded bymodern digital computers. However, we still study analog computers fortwo reasons. First, the availability of integrated op amps has made it pos-sible to build analog computers easily and cheaply. Second, understand-ing analog computers helps with the appreciation of the digital computers.d

require much more effort. If this is so, then you should always
keep in mind that time spent here will result in much less effortlater and most likely save you a lot of frustration in the process.
2.Present. Clearly, using the devices developed in Section 6.6.3
will allow us to create the desired analog computer circuit. Wewill need the integrator circuits (possibly combined with asumming capability) and one or more inverter circuits.
3.Alternative. The approach for solving this problem is straight-
forward. We will need to pick the correct values of resistancesand capacitors to allow us to realize the equation we are repre-senting. The ﬁnal output of the circuit will give the desiredresult.
4.Attempt. There are an inﬁnite number of possibilities for
picking the resistors and capacitors, many of which will resultin correct solutions. Extreme values of resistors and capacitorswill result in incorrect outputs. For example, low values ofresistors will overload the electronics. Picking values ofresistors that are too large will cause the op amps to stopfunctioning as ideal devices. The limits can be determined fromthe characteristics of the real op amp.
We ﬁrst solve for the second derivative as
(6.15.1)
Solving this requires some mathematical operations, includingsumming, scaling, and integration. Integrating both sides ofEq. (6.15.1) gives
(6.15.2)
where We implement Eq. (6.15.2) using the summingintegrator shown in Fig. 6.40(a). The values of the resistors andcapacitors have been chosen so that for the term
Other terms in the summing integrator of Eq. (6.15.2) are
implemented accordingly. The initial condition isimplemented by connecting a 1-V battery with a switch across thecapacitor as shown in Fig. 6.40(a).
The next step is to obtain by integrating and
inverting the result,
(6.15.3)
This is implemented with the circuit in Fig. 6.40(b) with thebattery giving the initial condition of V . We now combine thetwo circuits in Fig. 6.40(a) and (b) to obtain the complete circuitshown in Fig. 6.40(c). When the input signal is applied,we open the switches at to obtain the output waveform ,which may be viewed on an oscilloscope.v

5.Evaluate. The answer looks correct, but is it? If an actual
solution for is desired, then a good check would be to ﬁrst
ﬁnd the solution by realizing the circuit in PSpice. This result
could then be compared with a solution using the differentialsolution capability of MATLAB.
Since all we need to do is check the circuit and conﬁrm that
it represents the equation, we have an easier technique to use.We just go through the circuit and see if it generates the desired
equation.
However, we still have choices to make. We could go through
the circuit from left to right but that would involve differentiatingthe result to obtain the original equation. An easier approachwould be to go from right to left. This is the approach we willuse to check the answer.
Starting with the output, we see that the right-hand op
amp is nothing more than an inverter with a gain of one. Thismeans that the output of the middle circuit is The followingrepresents the action of the middle circuit.

We check the circuit on the left the same way.

Computers occupy a prominent place in modern soci-ety and education. They have become commonplace and are helping tochange the face of research, development, production, business, and enter-tainment. The scientist, engineer, doctor, attorney, teacher, airline pilot,businessperson—almost anyone beneﬁts from a computer’s abilities tostore large amounts of information and to process that information in veryshort periods of time. The internet, a computer communication network,is essential in business, education, and library science. Computer usagecontinues to grow by leaps and bounds.
An education in computer engineering should provide breadth in soft-
ware, hardware design, and basic modeling techniques. It should includecourses in data structures, digital systems, computer architecture, micro-processors, interfacing, software engineering, and operating systems.
Electrical engineers who specialize in computer engineering ﬁnd
jobs in computer industries and in numerous ﬁelds where computersare being used. Companies that produce software are growing rapidlyin number and size and providing employment for those who are skilledin programming. An excellent way to advance one’s knowledge ofcomputers is to join the IEEE Computer Society, which sponsorsdiverse magazines, journals, and conferences.

A ﬁrst-order circuit is characterized by a ﬁrst-order differential
equation.Introduction
Now that we have considered the three passive elements (resistors,
capacitors, and inductors) and one active element (the op amp) indi-vidually, we are prepared to consider circuits that contain various com-binations of two or three of the passive elements. In this chapter, weshall examine two types of simple circuits: a circuit comprising a resis-tor and capacitor and a circuit comprising a resistor and an inductor.These are called RC and RLcircuits, respectively. As simple as these
circuits are, they ﬁnd continual applications in electronics, communi-cations, and control systems, as we shall see.
We carry out the analysis of RC and RLcircuits by applying
Kirchhoff’s laws, as we did for resistive circuits. The only differenceis that applying Kirchhoff’s laws to purely resistive circuits results inalgebraic equations, while applying the laws to RCand RLcircuits pro-
duces differential equations, which are more difﬁcult to solve thanalgebraic equations. The differential equations resulting from analyz-ing RCand RLcircuits are of the ﬁrst order. Hence, the circuits are
collectively known as ﬁrst-order circuits.7.1254 Chapter 7 First-Order Circuits
In addition to there being two types of ﬁrst-order circuits ( RCand
RL), there are two ways to excite the circuits. The ﬁrst way is by ini-
tial conditions of the storage elements in the circuits. In these so-calledsource-free circuits, we assume that energy is initially stored in thecapacitive or inductive element. The energy causes current to ﬂow inthe circuit and is gradually dissipated in the resistors. Although source-free circuits are by deﬁnition free of independent sources, they mayhave dependent sources. The second way of exciting ﬁrst-order circuitsis by independent sources. In this chapter, the independent sources wewill consider are dc sources. (In later chapters, we shall consider sinu-soidal and exponential sources.) The two types of ﬁrst-order circuitsand the two ways of exciting them add up to the four possible situa-tions we will study in this chapter.
Finally, we consider four typical applications of RCand RLcir-
cuits: delay and relay circuits, a photoﬂash unit, and an automobileignition circuit.
The Source-Free RCCircuit
Asource-free RCcircuit occurs when its dc source is suddenly dis-
connected. The energy already stored in the capacitor is released to theresistors.
Consider a series combination of a resistor and an initially charged
capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.1. (The resistor and capacitor may be theequivalent resistance and equivalent capacitance of combinations ofresistors and capacitors.) Our objective is to determine the circuitresponse, which, for pedagogic reasons, we assume to be the voltage7.2

The natural response of a circuit refers to the behavior (in terms of
voltages and currents) of the circuit itself, with no external sources of
excitation.across the capacitor. Since the capacitor is initially charged, we
can assume that at time the initial voltage is

with the corresponding value of the energy stored as

Applying KCL at the top node of the circuit in Fig. 7.1 yields

This is a ﬁrst-order differential equation , since only the ﬁrst derivative

Integrating both sides, we get
where is the integration constant. Thus,

Taking powers of eproduces
But from the initial conditions, Hence,
(7.7)
This shows that the voltage response of the RCcircuit is an exponen-
tial decay of the initial voltage. Since the response is due to the initial
energy stored and the physical characteristics of the circuit and not dueto some external voltage or current source, it is called the natural
response of the circuit.v(t)/H11005V

nature of the circuit alone, with no ex-ternal sources. In fact, the circuit has aresponse only because of the energyinitially stored in the capacitor.ale29559_ch07.qxd  07/08/2008  11:49 AM  Page 255

This implies that at Eq. (7.7) becomes
or
(7.8)
In terms of the time constant, Eq. (7.7) can be written as
(7.9)
With a calculator it is easy to show that the value of is as
shown in Table 7.1. It is evident from Table 7.1 that the voltage 
is less than percent of after (ﬁve time constants). Thus, it iscustomary to assume that the capacitor is fully discharged (or charged)after ﬁve time constants. In other words, it takes for the circuit toreach its ﬁnal state or steady state when no changes take place withtime. Notice that for every time interval of the voltage is reducedby 36.8 percent of its previous value, regardless of the value of t.
Observe from Eq. (7.8) that the smaller the time constant, the more
rapidly the voltage decreases, that is, the faster the response. This isillustrated in Fig. 7.4. A circuit with a small time constant gives a fastresponse in that it reaches the steady state (or ﬁnal state) quickly dueto quick dissipation of energy stored, whereas a circuit with a largetime constant gives a slow response because it takes longer to reachsteady state. At any rate, whether the time constant is small or large,the circuit reaches steady state in ﬁve time constants.

Solution:
There are two ways we can solve this problem. One way is to obtainthe equivalent resistance at the inductor terminals and then useEq. (7.20). The other way is to start from scratch by using Kirchhoff’svoltage law. Whichever approach is taken, it is always better to ﬁrstobtain the inductor current.
■METHOD 1 The equivalent resistance is the same as the
Thevenin resistance at the inductor terminals. Because of the depend-ent source, we insert a voltage source with at the inductorterminals a-b, as in Fig. 7.14(a). (We could also insert a 1-A current

Determine and for all tin the circuit shown in Fig. 7.22.
Assume that the switch was closed for a long time. It should be noted
that opening a switch in series with an ideal current source creates aninﬁnite voltage at the current source terminals. Clearly this is impossi-ble. For the purposes of problem solving, we can place a shunt resis-tor in parallel with the source (which now makes it a voltage sourcein series with a resistor). In more practical circuits, devices that act likecurrent sources are, for the most part, electronic circuits. These circuitswill allow the source to act like an ideal current source over its oper-ating range but voltage-limit it when the load resistor becomes too large(as in an open circuit).

Singularity Functions
Before going on with the second half of this chapter, we need to digress
and consider some mathematical concepts that will aid our under-standing of transient analysis. A basic understanding of singularityfunctions will help us make sense of the response of ﬁrst-order circuitsto a sudden application of an independent dc voltage or current source.
Singularity functions (also called switching functions ) are very use-
ful in circuit analysis. They serve as good approximations to theswitching signals that arise in circuits with switching operations. Theyare helpful in the neat, compact description of some circuit phenom-ena, especially the step response of RC or RLcircuits to be discussed
in the next sections. By deﬁnition,7.4
Singularity functions are functions that either are discontinuous or have
discontinuous derivatives.t2

The unit step function u(t) is 0 for negative values of tand 1 for pos-
itive values of t.The three most widely used singularity functions in circuit analy-
sis are the unit step, the unit impulse, and the unit ramp functions.266 Chapter 7 First-Order Circuits
In mathematical terms,
(7.24)
The unit step function is undeﬁned at where it changes abruptly
from 0 to 1. It is dimensionless, like other mathematical functions suchas sine and cosine. Figure 7.23 depicts the unit step function. If theabrupt change occurs at (where ) instead of the unitstep function becomes
(7.25)
which is the same as saying that is delayed by seconds, as shownin Fig. 7.24(a). To get Eq. (7.25) from Eq. (7.24), we simply replaceevery tby If the change is at the unit step function
becomes
(7.26)
meaning that is advanced by seconds, as shown in Fig. 7.24(b).
We use the step function to represent an abrupt change in voltage
or current, like the changes that occur in the circuits of control systemsand digital computers. For example, the voltage
(7.27)
may be expressed in terms of the unit step function as
(7.28)

Impulsive currents and voltages occur in electric circuits as a result of
switching operations or impulsive sources. Although the unit impulsefunction is not physically realizable (just like ideal sources, idealresistors, etc.), it is a very useful mathematical tool.
The unit impulse may be regarded as an applied or resulting shock.
It may be visualized as a very short duration pulse of unit area. Thismay be expressed mathematically as
(7.30)
where denotes the time just before and is the timejust after For this reason, it is customary to write 1 (denotingunit area) beside the arrow that is used to symbolize the unit impulsefunction, as in Fig. 7.27. The unit area is known as the strength of the
impulse function. When an impulse function has a strength other thanunity, the area of the impulse is equal to its strength. For example, animpulse function has an area of 10. Figure 7.28 shows theimpulse functions and

Express the voltage pulse in Fig. 7.31 in terms of the unit step. Cal-
culate its derivative and sketch it.
Solution:
The type of pulse in Fig. 7.31 is called the gate function. It may be
regarded as a step function that switches on at one value of tand
switches off at another value of t. The gate function shown in Fig. 7.31
switches on at and switches off at It consists of thesum of two unit step functions as shown in Fig. 7.32(a). From theﬁgure, it is evident that

■METHOD 2 Aclose observation of Fig. 7.35 reveals that is
a multiplication of two functions: a ramp function and a gate function.Thus,
the same as before.
■METHOD 3 This method is similar to Method 2. We observe
from Fig. 7.35 that is a multiplication of a ramp function and a
unit step function, as shown in Fig. 7.38. Thus,

Step Response of an RCCircuit
When the dc source of an RCcircuit is suddenly applied, the voltage
or current source can be modeled as a step function, and the response
is known as a step response.7.5
The step response of a circuit is its behavior when the excitation is the
step function, which may be a voltage or a current source.ale29559_ch07.qxd  07/08/2008  11:49 AM  Page 273

The step response is the response of the circuit due to a sudden appli-
cation of a dc voltage or current source.
Consider the RC circuit in Fig. 7.40(a) which can be replaced by
the circuit in Fig. 7.40(b), where is a constant dc voltage source.Again, we select the capacitor voltage as the circuit response to bedetermined. We assume an initial voltage on the capacitor, althoughthis is not necessary for the step response. Since the voltage of a capac-itor cannot change instantaneously,

is its voltage immediately after switching. Applying KCL, we have

This is known as the complete response (or total response) of the RC
circuit to a sudden application of a dc voltage source, assuming the
capacitor is initially charged. The reason for the term “complete” willbecome evident a little later. Assuming that a plot of isshown in Fig. 7.41.
If we assume that the capacitor is uncharged initially, we set
in Eq. (7.46) so that

(7.48)
This is the complete step response of the RCcircuit when the capaci-
tor is initially uncharged. The current through the capacitor is obtainedfrom Eq. (7.47) using We get

Figure 7.42 shows the plots of capacitor voltage and capacitor cur-rent 
Rather than going through the derivations above, there is a sys-
tematic approach—or rather, a short-cut method—for ﬁnding the stepresponse of an RCor RLcircuit. Let us reexamine Eq. (7.45), which is
more general than Eq. (7.48). It is evident that has two components.Classically there are two ways of decomposing this into two compo-nents. The ﬁrst is to break it into a “natural response and a forcedresponse’’ and the second is to break it into a “transient response anda steady-state response.’’ Starting with the natural response and forcedresponse, we write the total or complete response as

where
andWe are familiar with the natural response of the circuit, as discussed
in Section 7.2. is known as the forced response because it is pro-
duced by the circuit when an external “force’’ (a voltage source in this
case) is applied. It represents what the circuit is forced to do by theinput excitation. The natural response eventually dies out along withthe transient component of the forced response, leaving only the steady-state component of the forced response.v

Another way of looking at the complete response is to break into
two components—one temporary and the other permanent, i.e.,
or
(7.51)
where
(7.52a)
and
(7.52b)
The transient response is temporary; it is the portion of the com-
plete response that decays to zero as time approaches inﬁnity. Thus,vtvss/H11005Vsvt/H11005(Vo/H11002Vs)e/H11002t/H20862tv/H11005vt/H11001vssComplete response /H11005transient response

The transient response is the circuit’s temporary response that will die
out with time.
The steady-state response is the portion of the complete response
that remains after the transient reponse has died out. Thus,vss
The ﬁrst decomposition of the complete response is in terms of the
source of the responses, while the second decomposition is in terms of
the permanency of the responses. Under certain conditions, the naturalresponse and transient response are the same. The same can be saidabout the forced response and steady-state response.
Whichever way we look at it, the complete response in Eq. (7.45)
may be written as
(7.53)
where is the initial voltage at and is the ﬁnal or steady-state value. Thus, to ﬁnd the step response of an RCcircuit requires
three things:v(/H11009) t/H110050
/H11001v(0)v(t)/H11005v(/H11009)/H11001[v(0) /H11002v(/H11009)]e/H11002t/H20862tThe steady-state response is the behavior of the circuit a long time
after an external excitation is applied.
1. The initial capacitor voltage 
2. The ﬁnal capacitor voltage 3. The time constant t.v(/H11009).v(0).
We obtain item 1 from the given circuit for and items 2 and 3
from the circuit for Once these items are determined, we obtain t70.t60This is the same as saying that the com-
plete response is the sum of the tran-sient response and the steady-stateresponse.
Once we know x(0), x(), and ,
almost all the circuit problems in this
chapter can be solved using theformula
x(t)/H11005x(/H11009)/H110013x(0) /H11002x(/H11009)4e

the response using Eq. (7.53). This technique equally applies to RLcir-
cuits, as we shall see in the next section.
Note that if the switch changes position at time instead of
at there is a time delay in the response so that Eq. (7.53)
becomes

Solution:
The resistor current ican be discontinuous at while the capacitor
voltage cannot. Hence, it is always better to ﬁnd and then obtain i
from
By deﬁnition of the unit step function,
For the switch is closed and so that the voltage source is replaced by a short circuit and should be regarded ascontributing nothing to Since the switch has been closed for a longtime, the capacitor voltage has reached steady state and the capacitoracts like an open circuit. Hence, the circuit becomes that shown inFig. 7.46(a) for From this circuit we obtain
Since the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously,
For the switch is opened and the 10-V voltage source is
disconnected from the circuit. The voltage source is now operative,
so the circuit becomes that shown in Fig. 7.46(b). After a long time, thecircuit reaches steady state and the capacitor acts like an open circuitagain. We obtain by using voltage division, writing

Step Response of an RLCircuit
Consider the RLcircuit in Fig. 7.48(a), which may be replaced by the
circuit in Fig. 7.48(b). Again, our goal is to ﬁnd the inductor current i
as the circuit response. Rather than apply Kirchhoff’s laws, we will use
the simple technique in Eqs. (7.50) through (7.53). Let the response bethe sum of the transient response and the steady-state response,

The steady-state response is the value of the current a long time after
the switch in Fig. 7.48(a) is closed. We know that the transient responseessentially dies out after ﬁve time constants. At that time, the inductorbecomes a short circuit, and the voltage across it is zero. The entiresource voltage appears across R . Thus, the steady-state response is
(7.57)
Substituting Eqs. (7.56) and (7.57) into Eq. (7.55) gives
(7.58)
We now determine the constant Afrom the initial value of i. Let be
the initial current through the inductor, which may come from a sourceother than Since the current through the inductor cannot changeinstantaneously,

Thus, at Eq. (7.58) becomes

First-Order Op Amp Circuits
An op amp circuit containing a storage element will exhibit ﬁrst-order
behavior. Differentiators and integrators treated in Section 6.6 areexamples of ﬁrst-order op amp circuits. Again, for practical reasons,inductors are hardly ever used in op amp circuits; therefore, the op ampcircuits we consider here are of the RC type.
As usual, we analyze op amp circuits using nodal analysis. Some-
times, the Thevenin equivalent circuit is used to reduce the op amp cir-cuit to one that we can easily handle. The following three examplesillustrate the concepts. The ﬁrst one deals with a source-free op ampcircuit, while the other two involve step responses. The three exampleshave been carefully selected to cover all possible RCtypes of op amp
circuits, depending on the location of the capacitor with respect to theop amp; that is, the capacitor can be located in the input, the output,or the feedback loop.7.710 Ω

Transient Analysis with PSpice
As we discussed in Section 7.5, the transient response is the temporary
response of the circuit that soon disappears. PSpice can be used to
obtain the transient response of a circuit with storage elements. Sec-tion D.4 in Appendix D provides a review of transient analysis usingPSpice for Windows. It is recommended that you read Section D.4before continuing with this section.
If necessary, dc PSpice analysis is ﬁrst carried out to determine the
initial conditions. Then the initial conditions are used in the transientPSpice analysis to obtain the transient responses. It is recommended
but not necessary that during this dc analysis, all capacitors should beopen-circuited while all inductors should be short-circuited.7.87.8 Transient Analysis with PSpice 289

To use PSpice, we ﬁrst draw the schematic as shown in Fig. 7.64.
We recall from Appendix D that the part name for a closed switch is
Sw_tclose. We do not need to specify the initial condition of theinductor because PSpice will determine that from the circuit. By
selecting Analysis/Setup/Transient, we set Print Step to 25 ms and
Final Step to After saving the circuit, we simulate by
selecting Analysis/Simulate. In the PSpice A/D window, we select
Trace/Add and display –I(L1) as the current through the inductor.

Note that the negative sign on I(L1) is needed because the current
enters through the upper terminal of the inductor, which happens to be
the negative terminal after one counterclockwise rotation. A way to avoidthe negative sign is to ensure that current enters pin 1 of the inductor.To obtain this desired direction of positive current ﬂow, the initially
horizontal inductor symbol should be rotated counterclockwise and placed in the desired location.270/H11034290 Chapter 7 First-Order Circuits

Solution:
1.Deﬁne. The problem is clearly stated and the circuit is clearly
labeled.
2.Present. Given the circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(a), determine the
response 
3.Alternative. We can solve this circuit using circuit analysis
techniques, nodal analysis, mesh analysis, or PSpice. Let us
solve the problem using circuit analysis techniques (this time
Thevenin equivalent circuits) and then check the answer usingtwo methods of PSpice.
4.Attempt. For time the switch on the left is open and the
switch on the right is closed. Assume that the switch on the righthas been closed long enough for the circuit to reach steady state;then the capacitor acts like an open circuit and the current fromthe 4-A source ﬂows through the parallel combination of the and producing a voltage equal
to 
At the switch on the left closes and the switch on
the right opens, producing the circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(b).
The easiest way to complete the solution is to ﬁnd the
Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor. The open-circuit voltage (with the capacitor removed) is equal to thevoltage drop across the resistor on the left, or 10 V (thevoltage drops uniformly across the resistor, 20 V , andacross the resistor, 10 V). This is The resistancelooking in where the capacitor was is equal to 
which is This produces the Thevenin
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(c). Matching up theboundary conditions and 
we get
5.Evaluate. There are two ways of solving the problem using
PSpice.
■METHOD 1 One way is to ﬁrst do the dc PSpice analysis to
determine the initial capacitor voltage. The schematic of the revelantcircuit is in Fig. 7.68(a). Two pseudocomponent VIEWPOINTs areinserted to measure the voltages at nodes 1 and 2. When the circuitis simulated, we obtain the displayed values in Fig. 7.68(a) as
and Thus, the initial capacitor voltage is 
The PSpice transient analysis uses this value along
with the schematic in Fig. 7.68(b). Once the circuit in Fig. 7.68(b)is drawn, we insert the capacitor initial voltage as Weselect Analysis/Setup/Transient and set Print Step to 0.1 s and
Final Step to After saving the circuit, we select Analysis/
Simulate to simulate the circuit. In the PSpice A/D window, we
select Trace/Add and display

since PSpice can handle the open and closed switches and determine
the initial conditions automatically. Using this approach, the schematic
is drawn as shown in Fig. 7.70. After drawing the circuit, we selectAnalysis/Setup/Transient and set Print Step to 0.1 s and Final Step

Applications
The various devices in which RCand RLcircuits ﬁnd applications
include ﬁltering in dc power supplies, smoothing circuits in digital com-
munications, differentiators, integrators, delay circuits, and relay circuits.Some of these applications take advantage of the short or long time con-stants of the RCor RLcircuits. We will consider four simple applica-
tions here. The ﬁrst two are RCcircuits, the last two are RL circuits.
7.9.1 Delay Circuits
An RCcircuit can be used to provide various time delays. Figure 7.73
shows such a circuit. It basically consists of an RC circuit with the capac-
itor connected in parallel with a neon lamp. The voltage source can pro-vide enough voltage to ﬁre the lamp. When the switch is closed, thecapacitor voltage increases gradually toward 110 V at a rate determinedby the circuit’s time constant, The lamp will act as an open (R

circuit and not emit light until the voltage across it exceeds a particular
level, say 70 V . When the voltage level is reached, the lamp ﬁres (goeson), and the capacitor discharges through it. Due to the low resistanceof the lamp when on, the capacitor voltage drops fast and the lamp turnsoff. The lamp acts again as an open circuit and the capacitor recharges.By adjusting we can introduce either short or long time delays intothe circuit and make the lamp ﬁre, recharge, and ﬁre repeatedly everytime constant because it takes a time period to getthe capacitor voltage high enough to ﬁre or low enough to turn off.
The warning blinkers commonly found on road construction sites
are one example of the usefulness of such an RCdelay circuit.t t/H11005(R

An electronic ﬂash unit provides a common example of an RCcircuit.
This application exploits the ability of the capacitor to oppose any
abrupt change in voltage. Figure 7.75 shows a simpliﬁed circuit. It con-sists essentially of a high-voltage dc supply, a current-limiting largeresistor and a capacitor Cin parallel with the ﬂashlamp of low
resistance When the switch is in position 1, the capacitor chargesslowly due to the large time constant ( ). As shown in
Fig. 7.76(a), the capacitor voltage rises gradually from zero to whileits current decreases gradually from to zero. The chargingtime is approximately ﬁve times the time constant,
(7.65)
With the switch in position 2, the capacitor voltage is discharged.
The low resistance of the photolamp permits a high dischargecurrent with peak in a short duration, as depicted in
Fig. 7.76(b). Discharging takes place in approximately ﬁve times thetime constant,

7.9.4 Automobile Ignition Circuit
The ability of inductors to oppose rapid change in current makes them
useful for arc or spark generation. An automobile ignition system takesadvantage of this feature.
The gasoline engine of an automobile requires that the fuel-air
mixture in each cylinder be ignited at proper times. This is achievedby means of a spark plug (Fig. 7.78), which essentially consists of apair of electrodes separated by an air gap. By creating a large voltage(thousands of volts) between the electrodes, a spark is formed acrossthe air gap, thereby igniting the fuel. But how can such a large volt-age be obtained from the car battery, which supplies only 12 V? Thisis achieved by means of an inductor (the spark coil) L. Since the volt-
age across the inductor is we can make large by cre-
ating a large change in current in a very short time. When the ignitionswitch in Fig. 7.78 is closed, the current through the inductor increasesgradually and reaches the ﬁnal value of where Again, the time taken for the inductor to charge is ﬁve times the time
constant of the circuit 
(7.67)
Since at steady state, i is constant, and the inductor voltage
When the switch suddenly opens, a large voltage is developed
across the inductor (due to the rapidly collapsing ﬁeld) causing a sparkor arc in the air gap. The spark continues until the energy stored in theinductor is dissipated in the spark discharge. In laboratories, when oneis working with inductive circuits, this same effect causes a very nastyshock, and one must exercise caution.v/H110050.di/H20862dt /H110050t

Summary
1. The analysis in this chapter is applicable to any circuit that can be
reduced to an equivalent circuit comprising a resistor and a single
energy-storage element (inductor or capacitor). Such a circuit isﬁrst-order because its behavior is described by a ﬁrst-order differ-ential equation. When analyzing RCand RLcircuits, one must
always keep in mind that the capacitor is an open circuit to steady-state dc conditions while the inductor is a short circuit to steady-state dc conditions.
2. The natural response is obtained when no independent source is
present. It has the general form
where xrepresents current through (or voltage across) a resistor, a
capacitor, or an inductor, and is the initial value of x.Because
most practical resistors, capacitors, and inductors always have losses,
the natural response is a transient response, i.e. it dies out with time.
3. The time constant is the time required for a response to decay
to of its initial value. For RC circuits, and for RLcir-
cuits, t/H11005L/H20862R.t/H11005RC l/H20862etx(0)x(t)/H11005x(0)e

4. The singularity functions include the unit step, the unit ramp func-
tion, and the unit impulse functions. The unit step function is
The unit impulse function is
The unit ramp function is
5. The steady-state response is the behavior of the circuit after an
independent source has been applied for a long time. The transient
response is the component of the complete response that dies outwith time.
6.The total or complete response consists of the steady-stateresponse and the transient response.
7. The step response is the response of the circuit to a sudden appli-
cation of a dc current or voltage. Finding the step response of aﬁrst-order circuit requires the initial value the ﬁnal value
and the time constant With these three items, we obtain
the step response as
Amore general form of this equation is
Or we may write it as
8.PSpice is very useful for obtaining the transient response of a circuit.
9.Four practical applications of RC and RLcircuits are: a delay circuit,
a photoﬂash unit, a relay circuit, and an automobile ignition circuit.Instantaneous value /H11005Final /H11001[Initial /H11002Final]e

Everyone who can earn a masters degree in engineering must earn a

Enhancing Your Career
To increase your engineering career opportunities after graduation,
develop a strong fundamental understanding in a broad set of engineer-ing areas. When possible, this might best be accomplished by workingtoward a graduate degree immediately upon receiving your undergradu-ate degree.
Each degree in engineering represents certain skills the student
acquires. At the Bachelor degree level, you learn the language of engi-neering and the fundamentals of engineering and design. At the Mas-ter’s level, you acquire the ability to do advanced engineering projectsand to communicate your work effectively both orally and in writing.The Ph.D. represents a thorough understanding of the fundamentals ofelectrical engineering and a mastery of the skills necessary both forworking at the frontiers of an engineering area and for communicatingone’s effort to others.
If you have no idea what career you should pursue after gradua-
tion, a graduate degree program will enhance your ability to explorecareer options. Since your undergraduate degree will only provide youwith the fundamentals of engineering, a Master’s degree in engineer-ing supplemented by business courses beneﬁts more engineering stu-dents than does getting a Master’s of Business Administration (MBA).The best time to get your MBA is after you have been a practicingengineer for some years and decide your career path would beenhanced by strengthening your business skills.
Engineers should constantly educate themselves, formally and
informally, taking advantage of all means of education. Perhaps thereis no better way to enhance your career than to join a professional soci-ety such as IEEE and be an active member.
Enhancing your career involves under-
standing your goals, adapting to changes,anticipating opportunities, and planningyour own niche.©2005 Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Introduction
In the previous chapter we considered circuits with a single storage ele-
ment (a capacitor or an inductor). Such circuits are ﬁrst-order becausethe differential equations describing them are ﬁrst-order. In this chap-ter we will consider circuits containing two storage elements. These areknown as second-order circuits because their responses are described
by differential equations that contain second derivatives.
Typical examples of second-order circuits are RLC circuits, in
which the three kinds of passive elements are present. Examples ofsuch circuits are shown in Fig. 8.1(a) and (b). Other examples are RL
and RCcircuits, as shown in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d). It is apparent from
Fig. 8.1 that a second-order circuit may have two storage elements ofdifferent type or the same type (provided elements of the same typecannot be represented by an equivalent single element). An op amp cir-cuit with two storage elements may also be a second-order circuit. Aswith ﬁrst-order circuits, a second-order circuit may contain severalresistors and dependent and independent sources.8.1314 Chapter 8 Second-Order Circuits
A second-order circuit is characterized by a second-order differen-
tial equation. It consists of resistors and the equivalent of two energy
storage elements.
Our analysis of second-order circuits will be similar to that used for
ﬁrst-order. We will ﬁrst consider circuits that are excited by the ini-tial conditions of the storage elements. Although these circuits maycontain dependent sources, they are free of independent sources.These source-free circuits will give natural responses as expected.Later we will consider circuits that are excited by independentsources. These circuits will give both the transient response and thesteady-state response. We consider only dc independent sources inthis chapter. The case of sinusoidal and exponential sources is deferredto later chapters.
We begin by learning how to obtain the initial conditions for the
circuit variables and their derivatives, as this is crucial to analyzingsecond-order circuits. Then we consider series and parallel RLC cir-
cuits such as shown in Fig. 8.1 for the two cases of excitation: byinitial conditions of the energy storage elements and by step inputs.Later we examine other types of second-order circuits, including opamp circuits. We will consider PSpice analysis of second-order cir-
cuits. Finally, we will consider the automobile ignition system andsmoothing circuits as typical applications of the circuits treated in thischapter. Other applications such as resonant circuits and ﬁlters willbe covered in Chapter 14.
Finding Initial and Final Values
Perhaps the major problem students face in handling second-order cir-cuits is ﬁnding the initial and ﬁnal conditions on circuit variables.Students are usually comfortable getting the initial and ﬁnal valuesof vand ibut often have difﬁculty ﬁnding the initial values of their8.2Figure 8.1

derivatives: and . For this reason, this section is explicitly
devoted to the subtleties of getting ,and Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, v denotes capacitor
voltage, while iis the inductor current.
There are two key points to keep in mind in determining the ini-
tial conditions.
First—as always in circuit analysis—we must carefully handle the
polarity of voltage across the capacitor and the direction of the cur-rent through the inductor. Keep in mind that vand iare deﬁned
strictly according to the passive sign convention (see Figs. 6.3 and 6.23).One should carefully observe how these are deﬁned and apply themaccordingly.
Second, keep in mind that the capacitor voltage is always contin-
uous so that
(8.1a)
and the inductor current is always continuous so that
(8.1b)
where denotes the time just before a switching event and
is the time just after the switching event, assuming that the
switching event takes place at .
Thus, in ﬁnding initial conditions, we ﬁrst focus on those vari-
ables that cannot change abruptly, capacitor voltage and inductor cur-rent, by applying Eq. (8.1). The following examples illustrate theseideas.t/H110050t/H110050

The switch in Fig. 8.2 has been closed for a long time. It is open at
. Find: (a) , (b) , (c) .
Solution:
(a) If the switch is closed a long time before , it means that the
circuit has reached dc steady state at At dc steady state, theinductor acts like a short circuit, while the capacitor acts like an opencircuit, so we have the circuit in Fig. 8.3(a) at Thus,

Solution:

steady state, the inductor can be replaced by a short circuit, while thecapacitor is replaced by an open circuit as shown in Fig. 8.6(a). Fromthis ﬁgure we obtain

The Source-Free Series RLCCircuit
An understanding of the natural response of the series RLC circuit is
a necessary background for future studies in ﬁlter design and commu-nications networks.
Consider the series RLC circuit shown in Fig. 8.8. The circuit is
being excited by the energy initially stored in the capacitor and induc-tor. The energy is represented by the initial capacitor voltage andinitial inductor current . Thus, at ,

To eliminate the integral, we differentiate with respect to t and
rearrange terms. We get
(8.4)
This is a second-order differential equation and is the reason for call-
ing the RLC circuits in this chapter second-order circuits. Our goal is
to solve Eq. (8.4). To solve such a second-order differential equation
requires that we have two initial conditions, such as the initial valueof iand its ﬁrst derivative or initial values of some i and The ini-
tial value of i is given in Eq. (8.2b). We get the initial value of the
derivative of i from Eqs. (8.2a) and (8.3); that is,
or
(8.5)
With the two initial conditions in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5), we can now
solve Eq. (8.4). Our experience in the preceding chapter on ﬁrst-ordercircuits suggests that the solution is of exponential form. So we let

expression in parentheses can be zero:

This quadratic equation is known as the characteristic equation of the
differential Eq. (8.4), since the roots of the equation dictate the char-acter of i. The two roots of Eq. (8.8) are

The roots and are called natural frequencies , measured in
nepers per second (Np/s), because they are associated with the natural
response of the circuit; is known as the r esonant frequency or
strictly as the undamped natural frequency , expressed in radians per

expressed in nepers per second. In terms of and , Eq. (8.8) can bewritten as
(8.8a)
The variables s and are important quantities we will be discussing
throughout the rest of the text.
The two values of s in Eq. (8.10) indicate that there are two pos-
sible solutions for i, each of which is of the form of the assumed solu-
tion in Eq. (8.6); that is,
(8.12)
Since Eq. (8.4) is a linear equation, any linear combination of thetwo distinct solutions and is also a solution of Eq. (8.4). A com-plete or total solution of Eq. (8.4) would therefore require a linearcombination of and . Thus, the natural response of the series RLC
circuit is

where the constants and are determined from the initial values
and in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5).
From Eq. (8.10), we can infer that there are three types of solutions:
1. If we have the overdamped case.
2. If we have the critically damped case.
3. If we have the underdamped case.
We will consider each of these cases separately.
Overdamped Case (0)
From Eqs. (8.9) and (8.10), implies When this
happens, both roots and are negative and real. The response is

The neper (Np) is a dimensionless unit
named after John Napier (1550–1617),
a Scottish mathematician.
The ratio /H208620is known as the damp-
ing ratio .z/H9275a
The response is overdamped when
the roots of the circuit’s characteristic
equation are unequal and real, critically
damped when the roots are equal and
real, and underdamped when the
roots are complex.ale29559_ch08.qxd  07/08/2008  11:15 AM  Page 321

For this case, Eq. (8.13) yields
where . This cannot be the solution, because the two ini-
tial conditions cannot be satisﬁed with the single constant . Whatthen could be wrong? Our assumption of an exponential solution isincorrect for the special case of critical damping. Let us go back toEq. (8.4). When , Eq. (8.4) becomes

If we let

This can be written as

Integrating both sides yields

cally damped circuit is a sum of two terms: a negative exponential anda negative exponential multiplied by a linear term, or

Once the inductor current is found for the RLC series circuit
as shown above, other circuit quantities such as individual elementvoltages can easily be found. For example, the resistor voltage is
and the inductor voltage is . The inductor cur-
rent is selected as the key variable to be determined ﬁrst in orderto take advantage of Eq. (8.1b).
We conclude this section by noting the following interesting, pecu-
liar properties of an RLC network:
1.The behavior of such a network is captured by the idea of damping,
which is the gradual loss of the initial stored energy, as evidenced bythe continuous decrease in the amplitude of the response. The damp-ing effect is due to the presence of resistance R. The damping factor
determines the rate at which the response is damped. If 
then and we have an LCcircuit with as the
undamped natural frequency. Since in this case, the responseis not only undamped but also oscillatory. The circuit is said to beloss-less, because the dissipating or damping element ( R) is absent.
By adjusting the value of R, the response may be made undamped,
overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped.
2. Oscillatory response is possible due to the presence of the two
types of storage elements. Having both LandCallows the ﬂow ofa6/H9275

R 0 produces a perfectly sinusoidal
response. This response cannot be
practically accomplished with Land C
because of the inherent losses in them.See Figs 6.8 and 6.26. An electronicdevice called an 
oscillator can pro-
duce a perfectly sinusoidal response./H11005
Examples 8.5 and 8.7 demonstrate the
effect of varying R.
The response of a second-order circuit
with two storage elements of the sametype, as in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d), cannotbe oscillatory.ale29559_ch08.qxd  07/08/2008  11:15 AM  Page 323

energy back and forth between the two. The damped oscillation
exhibited by the underdamped response is known as ringing.I t
stems from the ability of the storage elements LandCto transfer
energy back and forth between them.
3. Observe from Fig. 8.9 that the waveforms of the responses differ.
In general, it is difﬁcult to tell from the waveforms the differencebetween the overdamped and critically damped responses. The crit-ically damped case is the borderline between the underdamped andoverdamped cases and it decays the fastest. With the same initialconditions, the overdamped case has the longest settling time,because it takes the longest time to dissipate the initial storedenergy. If we desire the response that approaches the ﬁnal valuemost rapidly without oscillation or ringing, the critically dampedcircuit is the right choice.324 Chapter 8 Second-Order Circuits
What this means in most practical cir-
cuits is  that we seek an overdampedcircuit that is as close as possible to acritically damped circuit.
Example 8.3 In Fig. 8.8, and Calculate the charac-
teristic roots of the circuit. Is the natural response overdamped, under-
damped, or critically damped?
Solution:
We ﬁrst calculate
The roots are
or
Since we conclude that the response is overdamped. This is
also evident from the fact that the roots are real and negative.a7/H92750,s1/H11005/H11002 0.101,  s2/H11005/H11002 9.899s1,2/H11005/H11002a/H110062a2/H11002/H927502/H11005/H11002 5/H11006225 /H110021a/H11005R

Since the three elements are in parallel, they have the same voltage v
across them. According to passive sign convention, the current is enter-
ing each element; that is, the current through each element is leavingthe top node. Thus, applying KCL at the top node gives

as they play the same role in the solution. Again, there are three pos-sible solutions, depending on whether or Let us consider these cases separately.

depend on whether the circuit is overdamped, underdamped, or criti-cally damped.

cuit as shown above, we can readily obtain other circuit quantities suchas individual element currents. For example, the resistor current is
and the capacitor voltage is We have selected
the capacitor voltage as the key variable to be determined ﬁrst inorder to take advantage of Eq. (8.1a). Notice that we ﬁrst found theinductor current for the RLC series circuit, whereas we ﬁrst found

The transient response is the component of the total response thatdies out with time. The form of the transient response is the same as theform of the solution obtained in Section 8.3 for the source-free circuit,given by Eqs. (8.14), (8.21), and (8.26). Therefore, the transient repsonse
for the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped cases are:
(8.42a)
(8.42b)
(8.42c)
The steady-state response is the ﬁnal value of . In the circuit inFig. 8.18, the ﬁnal value of the capacitor voltage is the same as thesource voltage . Hence,
(8.43)
Thus, the complete solutions for the overdamped, underdamped, andcritically damped cases are:
(8.44a)
(8.44b)
(8.44c)
The values of the constants and are obtained from the initial con-ditions: and Keep in mind that vand iare, respectively,
the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the inductor.Therefore, Eq. (8.44) only applies for ﬁnding v. But once the capaci-
tor voltage is known, we can determine which isthe same current through the capacitor, inductor, and resistor. Hence,the voltage across the resistor is while the inductor voltage is
Alternatively, the complete response for any variable can be
found directly, because it has the general form

across the resistor; that is,
For the switch is opened, so that we have the resistor
disconnected. What remains is the series RLC circuit with the voltage
source. The characteristic roots are determined as follows:

General Second-Order Circuits
Now that we have mastered series and parallel RLC circuits, we are
prepared to apply the ideas to any second-order circuit having one or
more independent sources with constant values. Although the series andparallel RLC circuits are the second-order circuits of greatest interest,
other second-order circuits including op amps are also useful. Given asecond-order circuit, we determine its step response (which maybe voltage or current) by taking the following four steps:
1. We ﬁrst determine the initial conditions and and the
ﬁnal value as discussed in Section 8.2.
2.We turn off the independent sources and ﬁnd the form of the tran-
sient response by applying KCL and KVL. Once a second-orderdifferential equation is obtained, we determine its characteristicroots. Depending on whether the response is overdamped, criticallydamped, or underdamped, we obtain with two unknown con-stants as we did in the previous sections.
3. We obtain the steady-state response as
(8.51)
where is the ﬁnal value of x, obtained in step 1.
4.The total response is now found as the sum of the transientresponse and steady-state response
(8.52)
We ﬁnally determine the constants associated with the transient
response by imposing the initial conditions and determined in step 1.
We can apply this general procedure to ﬁnd the step response of
any second-order circuit, including those with op amps. The following
examples illustrate the four steps.dx(0)/H20862dt, x(0)x(t)/H11005x

A circuit may look complicated at ﬁrst.

ducible to a ﬁrst-order circuit, the solu-tion becomes simply what we had inChapter 7. If it is reducible to a parallelor series

Second-Order Op Amp Circuits
An op amp circuit with two storage elements that cannot be combined
into a single equivalent element is second-order. Because inductors arebulky and heavy, they are rarely used in practical op amp circuits. Forthis reason, we will only consider RC second-order op amp circuits
here. Such circuits ﬁnd a wide range of applications in devices such asﬁlters and oscillators.
The analysis of a second-order op amp circuit follows the same
four steps given and demonstrated in the previous section.8.8344 Chapter 8 Second-Order Circuits

As the circuit reaches the steady-state condition, and the
capacitors can be replaced by open circuits. Since no current ﬂows through

RLC circuits can be analyzed with great ease using PSpice, just like
the RCor RLcircuits of Chapter 7. The following two examples will
illustrate this. The reader may review Section D.4 in Appendix D on
PSpice for transient analysis.8.9
The input voltage in Fig. 8.35(a) is applied to the circuit in Fig. 8.35(b).

Solution:
1.Deﬁne. As true with most textbook problems, the problem is
clearly deﬁned.
2.Present. The input is equal to a single square wave of
amplitude 12 V with a period of 2 s. We are asked to plot theoutput, using PSpice.
3.Alternative. Since we are required to use PSpice, that is the
only alternative for a solution. However, we can check it usingthe technique illustrated in Section 8.5 (a step response for aseries RLC circuit).
4.Attempt. The given circuit is drawn using Schematics as in
Fig. 8.36. The pulse is speciﬁed using VPWL voltage source,but VPULSE could be used instead. Using the piecewise linearfunction, we set the attributes of VPWL as 
and so forth, as shown in Fig. 8.36.
Two voltage markers are inserted to plot the input and output
voltages. Once the circuit is drawn and the attributes are set,we select Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the Transient
Analysis dialog box. As a parallel RLC circuit, the roots of the
characteristic equation are and Thus, we may set FinalTimeas 4 s (four times the magnitude of the lower root). When/H110029. /H110021V2/H1100512, T2/H110050.001,V1/H110050, T1/H110050,06t64 s. v(t)

Duality
The concept of duality is a time-saving, effort-effective measure of
solving circuit problems. Consider the similarity between Eq. (8.4) andEq. (8.29). The two equations are the same, except that we must inter-change the following quantities: (1) voltage and current, (2) resistanceand conductance, (3) capacitance and inductance. Thus, it sometimesoccurs in circuit analysis that two different circuits have the same equa-tions and solutions, except that the roles of certain complementary ele-ments are interchanged. This interchangeability is known as theprinciple of duality.8.10350 Chapter 8 Second-Order Circuits
The duality principle asserts a parallelism between pairs of characteriz-
ing equations and theorems of electric circuits.
Dual pairs are shown in Table 8.1. Note that power does not appear in
Table 8.1, because power has no dual. The reason for this is the prin-
ciple of linearity; since power is not linear, duality does not apply. Alsonotice from Table 8.1 that the principle of duality extends to circuitelements, conﬁgurations, and theorems.
Two circuits that are described by equations of the same form, but
in which the variables are interchanged, are said to be dual to eachother.
Two circuits are said to be duals of one another if they are described
by the same characterizing equations with dual quantities interchanged.
The usefulness of the duality principle is self-evident. Once we
know the solution to one circuit, we automatically have the solution
for the dual circuit. It is obvious that the circuits in Figs. 8.8 and 8.13are dual. Consequently, the result in Eq. (8.32) is the dual of that inEq. (8.11). We must keep in mind that the principle of duality is lim-ited to planar circuits. Nonplanar circuits have no duals, as they can-not be described by a system of mesh equations.
To ﬁnd the dual of a given circuit, we do not need to write down
the mesh or node equations. We can use a graphical technique. Givena planar circuit, we construct the dual circuit by taking the followingthree steps:
1. Place a node at the center of each mesh of the given circuit. Place
the reference node (the ground) of the dual circuit outside thegiven circuit.
2. Draw lines between the nodes such that each line crosses an ele-
ment. Replace that element by its dual (see Table 8.1).
3.To determine the polarity of voltage sources and direction of cur-
rent sources, follow this rule: A voltage source that produces a pos-itive (clockwise) mesh current has as its dual a current source whosereference direction is from the ground to the nonreference node.
In case of doubt, one may verify the dual circuit by writing the nodalor mesh equations. The mesh (or nodal) equations of the original circuitare similar to the nodal (or mesh) equations of the dual circuit. Theduality principle is illustrated with the following two examples.

Even when the principle of linearity
applies, a circuit element or variablemay not have a dual.  For example,mutual inductance (to be covered inChapter 13) has no dual.ale29559_ch08.qxd  07/17/2008  11:26 AM  Page 350
8.10 Duality 351
Construct the dual of the circuit in Fig. 8.44.
Solution:
As shown in Fig. 8.45(a), we ﬁrst locate nodes 1 and 2 in the twomeshes and also the ground node 0 for the dual circuit. We draw a linebetween one node and another crossing an element. We replace the linejoining the nodes by the duals of the elements which it crosses. Forexample, a line between nodes 1 and 2 crosses a 2-H inductor, and weplace a 2-F capacitor (an inductor’s dual) on the line. A line betweennodes 1 and 0 crossing the 6-V voltage source will contain a 6-Acurrent source. By drawing lines crossing all the elements, we constructthe dual circuit on the given circuit as in Fig. 8.45(a). The dual circuitis redrawn in Fig. 8.45(b) for clarity.Example 8.14

Applications
Practical applications of RLC circuits are found in control and com-
munications circuits such as ringing circuits, peaking circuits, resonant
circuits, smoothing circuits, and ﬁlters. Most of these circuits cannotbe covered until we treat ac sources. For now, we will limit ourselvesto two simple applications: automobile ignition and smoothing circuits.
8.11.1 Automobile Ignition System
In Section 7.9.4, we considered the automobile ignition system as acharging system. That was only a part of the system. Here, we con-sider another part—the voltage generating system. The system is mod-eled by the circuit shown in Fig. 8.52. The 12-V source is due to thebattery and alternator. The resistor represents the resistance of thewiring. The ignition coil is modeled by the 8-mH inductor. The capacitor (known as the condenser to automechanics) is in parallel with
the switch (known as the breaking points or electronic ignition). In the
following example, we determine how the RLC circuit in Fig. 8.52 is
used in generating high voltage.1-mF4-/H90248.118.11 Applications 353

8.11.2 Smoothing Circuits
In a typical digital communication system, the signal to be transmitted
is ﬁrst sampled. Sampling refers to the procedure of selecting samplesof a signal for processing, as opposed to processing the entire signal.Each sample is converted into a binary number represented by a seriesof pulses. The pulses are transmitted by a transmission line such as acoaxial cable, twisted pair, or optical ﬁber. At the receiving end, thesignal is applied to a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter whose output isa “staircase” function, that is, constant at each time interval. In orderto recover the transmitted analog signal, the output is smoothed by let-ting it pass through a “smoothing” circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 8.53.An RLC circuit may be used as the smoothing circuit.12/H1100212e

where is the damping factor and is the
undamped natural frequency. For a series circuit, for a
parallel circuit and for both cases 
3. If there are no independent sources in the circuit after switching
(or sudden change), we regard the circuit as source-free. The com-plete solution is the natural response.
4.The natural response of an RLC circuit is overdamped, under-
damped, or critically damped, depending on the roots of the char-acteristic equation. The response is critically damped when theroots are equal ( or ), overdamped when the rootsare real and unequal ( or ), or underdamped whenthe roots are complex conjugate ( or ).
5. If independent sources are present in the circuit after switching,
the complete response is the sum of the transient response and thesteady-state response.
6.PSpice is used to analyze RLC circuits in the same way as for RC
or RLcircuits.
7. Two circuits are dual if the mesh equations that describe one circuit
have the same form as the nodal equations that describe the other.The analysis of one circuit gives the analysis of its dual circuit.

ical applications of the material covered in this chapter.a6/H9275

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.d), “an ability to function on
multi-disciplinary teams.”
The “ability to function on multidisciplinary teams” is inherently crit-ical for the working engineer. Engineers rarely, if ever, work by them-selves. Engineers will always be part of some team. One of the thingsI like to remind students is that you do not have to like everyone on ateam; you just have to be a successful part of that team.
Most frequently, these teams include individuals from of a variety
of engineering disciplines, as well as individuals from nonengineeringdisciplines such as marketing and ﬁnance.
Students can easily develop and enhance this skill by working in
study groups in every course they take. Clearly, working in studygroups in nonengineering courses as well as engineering courses out-side your discipline will also give you experience with multidiscipli-nary teams.

Introduction
Thus far our analysis has been limited for the most part to dc circuits:
those circuits excited by constant or time-invariant sources. We haverestricted the forcing function to dc sources for the sake of simplicity,for pedagogic reasons, and also for historic reasons. Historically, dcsources were the main means of providing electric power up until thelate 1800s. At the end of that century, the battle of direct current ver-sus alternating current began. Both had their advocates among the elec-trical engineers of the time. Because ac is more efﬁcient and economicalto transmit over long distances, ac systems ended up the winner. Thus,it is in keeping with the historical sequence of events that we consid-ered dc sources ﬁrst.
We now begin the analysis of circuits in which the source voltage or
current is time-varying. In this chapter, we are particularly interested insinusoidally time-varying excitation, or simply, excitation by a sinusoid.9.1370 Chapter 9 Sinusoids and Phasors
Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) and George Westinghouse (1846–1914)
helped establish alternating current as the primary mode of electricity
transmission and distribution.
Today it is obvious that ac generation is well established as the form
of electric power that makes widespread distribution of electric powerefﬁcient and economical. However, at the end of the 19th century, whichwas the better—ac or dc—was hotly debated and had extremely out-spoken supporters on both sides. The dc side was lead by ThomasEdison, who had earned a lot of respect for his many contributions.Power generation using ac really began to build after the successful con-tributions of Tesla. The real commercial success in ac came from GeorgeWestinghouse and the outstanding team, including Tesla, he assembled.
In addition, two other big names were C. F. Scott and B. G. Lamme.
The most signiﬁcant contribution to the early success of ac was
the patenting of the polyphase ac motor by Tesla in 1888. The induc-tion motor and polyphase generation and distribution systems doomedthe use of dc as the prime energy source.
Historical
A sinusoid is a signal that has the form of the sine or cosine function.
Asinusoidal current is usually referred to as alternating current (ac).
Such a current reverses at regular time intervals and has alternately pos-
itive and negative values. Circuits driven by sinusoidal current or volt-age sources are called ac circuits.
We are interested in sinusoids for a number of reasons. First, nature
itself is characteristically sinusoidal. We experience sinusoidal varia-tion in the motion of a pendulum, the vibration of a string, the rippleson the ocean surface, and the natural response of underdamped second-order systems, to mention but a few. Second, a sinusoidal signal is easyto generate and transmit. It is the form of voltage generated throughout

the world and supplied to homes, factories, laboratories, and so on. It
is the dominant form of signal in the communications and electricpower industries. Third, through Fourier analysis, any practical peri-odic signal can be represented by a sum of sinusoids. Sinusoids,therefore, play an important role in the analysis of periodic signals.Lastly, a sinusoid is easy to handle mathematically. The derivativeand integral of a sinusoid are themselves sinusoids. For these andother reasons, the sinusoid is an extremely important function incircuit analysis.
Asinusoidal forcing function produces both a transient response
and a steady-state response, much like the step function, which we stud-ied in Chapters 7 and 8. The transient response dies out with time sothat only the steady-state response remains. When the transient responsehas become negligibly small compared with the steady-state response,we say that the circuit is operating at sinusoidal steady state. It is thissinusoidal steady-state response that is of main interest to us in this
chapter.
We begin with a basic discussion of sinusoids and phasors. We
then introduce the concepts of impedance and admittance. The basiccircuit laws, Kirchhoff’s and Ohm’s, introduced for dc circuits, will beapplied to ac circuits. Finally, we consider applications of ac circuitsin phase-shifters and bridges.
Sinusoids
Consider the sinusoidal voltage

The sinusoid is shown in Fig. 9.1(a) as a function of its argument and
in Fig. 9.1(b) as a function of time. It is evident that the sinusoidrepeats itself every T seconds; thus, T is called the period of the sinu-
soid. From the two plots in Fig. 9.1, we observe that

As mentioned, the period T of the periodic function is the time of one
complete cycle or the number of seconds per cycle. The reciprocal of
this quantity is the number of cycles per second, known as the cyclic
frequency f of the sinusoid. Thus,

cist, demonstrated that electromagnetic waves obey the same funda-
mental laws as light. His work conﬁrmed James Clerk Maxwell’scelebrated 1864 theory and prediction that such waves existed.
Hertz was born into a prosperous family in Hamburg, Germany.
He attended the University of Berlin and did his doctorate under theprominent physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. He became a professorat Karlsruhe, where he began his quest for electromagnetic waves.Hertz successfully generated and detected electromagnetic waves; hewas the ﬁrst to show that light is electromagnetic energy. In 1887, Hertznoted for the ﬁrst time the photoelectric effect of electrons in a molec-ular structure. Although Hertz only lived to the age of 37, his discov-ery of electromagnetic waves paved the way for the practical use ofsuch waves in radio, television, and other communication systems. Theunit of frequency, the hertz, bears his name.

phase can be in radians or degrees.
Let us examine the two sinusoids

time. Therefore, we say that leads by or that lags by

ima at exactly the same time. We can compare and in this man-ner because they operate at the same frequency; they do not need tohave the same amplitude.v

Two sinusoids with different phases.
Asinusoid can be expressed in either sine or cosine form. When
comparing two sinusoids, it is expedient to express both as either sineor cosine with positive amplitudes. This is achieved by using the fol-lowing trigonometric identities:
(9.9)
With these identities, it is easy to show that
(9.10)
Using these relationships, we can transform a sinusoid from sine formto cosine form or vice versa. sin(/H9275t/H11006180/H11034) /H11005/H11002 sin  /H9275t

Agraphical approach may be used to relate or compare sinusoids
as an alternative to using the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and
(9.10). Consider the set of axes shown in Fig. 9.3(a). The horizontal axisrepresents the magnitude of cosine, while the vertical axis (pointingdown) denotes the magnitude of sine. Angles are measured positivelycounterclockwise from the horizontal, as usual in polar coordinates.This graphical technique can be used to relate two sinusoids. For exam-ple, we see in Fig. 9.3(a) that subtracting from the argument of
gives or Similarly, adding to
the argument of gives or as
shown in Fig. 9.3(b).
The graphical technique can also be used to add two sinusoids of
the same frequency when one is in sine form and the other is in cosineform. To add and we note that Ais the magnitude of
while Bis the magnitude of as shown in Fig. 9.4(a). The
magnitude and argument of the resultant sinusoid in cosine form isreadily obtained from the triangle. Thus,
(9.11)
where
(9.12)
For example, we may add and as shown in Fig. 9.4(b)and obtain
(9.13)
Compared with the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and
(9.10), the graphical approach eliminates memorization. However, wemust not confuse the sine and cosine axes with the axes for complexnumbers to be discussed in the next section. Something else to note inFigs. 9.3 and 9.4 is that although the natural tendency is to have thevertical axis point up, the positive direction of the sine function is downin the present case.3 cos

Phasors
Sinusoids are easily expressed in terms of phasors, which are more con-
venient to work with than sine and cosine functions.9.3i2. 155/H11034, i 1i2 i1i1/H11005/H11002 4 sin(377 t/H1100125/H11034)  and  i2/H110055 cos(377t /H1100240/H11034)Practice Problem 9.2
A phasor is a complex number that represents the amplitude and
phase of a sinusoid.
Phasors provide a simple means of analyzing linear circuits excited by
sinusoidal sources; solutions of such circuits would be intractable oth-erwise. The notion of solving ac circuits using phasors was ﬁrst intro-duced by Charles Steinmetz in 1893. Before we completely deﬁnephasors and apply them to circuit analysis, we need to be thoroughlyfamiliar with complex numbers.
Acomplex number zcan be written in rectangular form as
(9.14a)
where xis the real part of z; yis the imaginary part of z.
In this context, the variables xand ydo not represent a location as in
two-dimensional vector analysis but rather the real and imaginary partsof zin the complex plane. Nevertheless, we note that there are some
resemblances between manipulating complex numbers and manipulat-ing two-dimensional vectors.
The complex number z can also be written in polar or exponential
form as

where ris the magnitude of z, and is the phase of z. We notice that
zcan be represented in three ways:
(9.15)
The relationship between the rectangular form and the polar form
is shown in Fig. 9.6, where the xaxis represents the real part and the
yaxis represents the imaginary part of a complex number. Given xand
y, we can get r and as
(9.16a)
On the other hand, if we know rand we can obtain xand yas
(9.16b)
Thus, zmay be written as
(9.17)
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are better performed
in rectangular form; multiplication and division are better done in polar
form. Given the complex numbers
the following operations are important.

Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865–1923), a German-Austrian
mathematician and engineer, introduced the phasor method (covered in
this chapter) in ac circuit analysis. He is also noted for his work on thetheory of hysteresis.
Steinmetz was born in Breslau, Germany, and lost his mother at the
age of one. As a youth, he was forced to leave Germany because ofhis political activities just as he was about to complete his doctoral dis-sertation in mathematics at the University of Breslau. He migrated toSwitzerland and later to the United States, where he was employed byGeneral Electric in 1893. That same year, he published a paper inwhich complex numbers were used to analyze ac circuits for the ﬁrsttime. This led to one of his many textbooks, Theory and Calculation
of ac Phenomena, published by McGraw-Hill in 1897. In 1901, hebecame the president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,which later became the IEEE.Historical

Vis thus the phasor representation of the sinusoid as we said ear-
lier. In other words, a phasor is a complex representation of the mag-
nitude and phase of a sinusoid. Either Eq. (9.20a) or Eq. (9.20b) canbe used to develop the phasor, but the standard convention is to useEq. (9.20a).
One way of looking at Eqs. (9.23) and (9.24) is to consider the plot
of the sinor on the complex plane. As time increases,
the sinor rotates on a circle of radius at an angular velocity in thecounterclockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 9.7(a). We may regard as the projection of the sinor on the real axis, as shown inFig. 9.7(b). The value of the sinor at time is the phasor Vof the
sinusoid The sinor may be regarded as a rotating phasor. Thus, when-ever a sinusoid is expressed as a phasor, the term is implicitly pres-ent. It is therefore important, when dealing with phasors, to keep in mindthe frequency of the phasor; otherwise we can make serious mistakes. /H9275e

A phasor may be regarded as a mathe-
matical equivalent of a sinusoid withthe time dependence dropped.
If we use sine for the phasor instead of
cosine, then v(t)Vmsin( t )
Im(Vmej(t )) and the corresponding
phasor is the same as that in Eq. (9.24)./H11001f /H9275/H11005 /H11001f /H9275 /H11005

Equation (9.23) states that to obtain the sinusoid corresponding to
a given phasor V, multiply the phasor by the time factor and take
the real part. As a complex quantity, a phasor may be expressed in rec-tangular form, polar form, or exponential form. Since a phasor hasmagnitude and phase (“direction”), it behaves as a vector and is printedin boldface. For example, phasors and are
graphically represented in Fig. 9.8. Such a graphical representation ofphasors is known as a phasor diagram.
Equations (9.21) through (9.23) reveal that to get the phasor cor-
responding to a sinusoid, we ﬁrst express the sinusoid in the cosineform so that the sinusoid can be written as the real part of a complexnumber. Then we take out the time factor and whatever is left isthe phasor corresponding to the sinusoid. By suppressing the time fac-tor, we transform the sinusoid from the time domain to the phasordomain. This transformation is summarized as follows:

We use lightface italic letters such as
zto represent complex numbers but
boldface letters such as Vto represent
phasors, because phasors are vector-
like quantities.ale29559_ch09.qxd  07/08/2008  11:54 AM  Page 379

Given a sinusoid we obtain the corre-
sponding phasor as Equation (9.25) is also demonstrated
in Table 9.1, where the sine function is considered in addition to the
cosine function. From Eq. (9.25), we see that to get the phasor repre-sentation of a sinusoid, we express it in cosine form and take themagnitude and phase. Given a phasor, we obtain the time domainrepresentation as the cosine function with the same magnitude as thephasor and the argument as plus the phase of the phasor. The ideaof expressing information in alternate domains is fundamental to allareas of engineering./H9275tV/H11005V

This shows that the derivative is transformed to the phasor domain

Similarly, the integral of is transformed to the phasor domainas

Equation (9.27) allows the replacement of a derivative with respect
to time with multiplication of in the phasor domain, whereasEq. (9.28) allows the replacement of an integral with respect to timewith division by in the phasor domain. Equations (9.27) and (9.28)are useful in ﬁnding the steady-state solution, which does not requireknowing the initial values of the variable involved. This is one of theimportant applications of phasors.
Besides time differentiation and integration, another important
use of phasors is found in summing sinusoids of the same fre-quency. This is best illustrated with an example, and Example 9.6provides one.
The differences between and Vshould be emphasized:
1. is the instantaneous or time domain representation, while is
the frequency or phasor domain representation.
2. is time dependent, while is not. (This fact is often forgot-
ten by students.)
3. is always real with no complex term, while is generally
complex.
Finally, we should bear in mind that phasor analysis applies only whenfrequency is constant; it applies in manipulating two or more sinusoidalsignals only if they are of the same frequency.V v(t)V v(t)V v(t)v(t)j/H9275j/H9275V

Phasor Relationships
for Circuit Elements
Now that we know how to represent a voltage or current in the pha-
sor or frequency domain, one may legitimately ask how we apply thisto circuits involving the passive elements R, L, and C. What we need
to do is to transform the voltage-current relationship from the timedomain to the frequency domain for each element. Again, we willassume the passive sign convention.
We begin with the resistor. If the current through a resistor Ris
the voltage across it is given by Ohm’s law as
(9.29)
The phasor form of this voltage is
(9.30)
But the phasor representation of the current is Hence,
(9.31)
showing that the voltage-current relation for the resistor in the phasordomain continues to be Ohm’s law, as in the time domain. Figure 9.9illustrates the voltage-current relations of a resistor. We should notefrom Eq. (9.31) that voltage and current are in phase, as illustrated inthe phasor diagram in Fig. 9.10.
For the inductor L , assume the current through it is 
The voltage across the inductor is
(9.32)
Recall from Eq. (9.10) that We can write the
voltage as
(9.33)
which transforms to the phasor
(9.34)
But and from Eq. (9.19), Thus,
(9.35)
showing that the voltage has a magnitude of and a phase of
The voltage and current are out of phase. Speciﬁcally, the
current lags the voltage by Figure 9.11 shows the voltage-currentrelations for the inductor. Figure 9.12 shows the phasor diagram.
For the capacitor C , assume the voltage across it is 
The current through the capacitor is
(9.36)
By following the same steps as we took for the inductor or by apply-ing Eq. (9.27) on Eq. (9.36), we obtain

Impedance and Admittance
In the preceding section, we obtained the voltage-current relations for
the three passive elements as
(9.38)
These equations may be written in terms of the ratio of the phasor volt-age to the phasor current as
(9.39)
From these three expressions, we obtain Ohm’s law in phasor form forany type of element as

The impedance represents the opposition that the circuit exhibits to
the ﬂow of sinusoidal current. Although the impedance is the ratio oftwo phasors, it is not a phasor, because it does not correspond to a sinu-soidally varying quantity.
The impedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors can be
readily obtained from Eq. (9.39). Table 9.3 summarizes their imped-ances. From the table we notice that and Consider two extreme cases of angular frequency. When (i.e.,for dc sources), and conﬁrming what we alreadyknow—that the inductor acts like a short circuit, while the capacitoracts like an open circuit. When (i.e., for high frequencies),
and indicating that the inductor is an open circuit
to high frequencies, while the capacitor is a short circuit. Figure 9.15illustrates this.
As a complex quantity, the impedence may be expressed in rec-
tangular form as
(9.41)
where is the resistance and is the reactance. The
reactance Xmay be positive or negative. We say that the impedance is
inductive when X is positive or capacitive when Xis negative. Thus,
impedance is said to be inductive or lagging since current
lags voltage, while impedance is capacitive or leading
because current leads voltage. The impedance, resistance, and reactanceare all measured in ohms. The impedance may also be expressed inpolar form as

Applications
In Chapters 7 and 8, we saw certain uses of RC, RL, and RLC circuits
in dc applications. These circuits also have ac applications; among them
are coupling circuits, phase-shifting circuits, ﬁlters, resonant circuits, acbridge circuits, and transformers. This list of applications is inexhaus-tive. We will consider some of them later. It will sufﬁce here to observetwo simple ones: RCphase-shifting circuits, and ac bridge circuits.
9.8.1 Phase-Shifters
Aphase-shifting circuit is often employed to correct an undesirable
phase shift already present in a circuit or to produce special desiredeffects. An RCcircuit is suitable for this purpose because its capacitor
causes the circuit current to lead the applied voltage. Two commonlyused RCcircuits are shown in Fig. 9.31. ( RLcircuits or any reactive
circuits could also serve the same purpose.)
In Fig. 9.31(a), the circuit current Ileads the applied voltage 
by some phase angle where depending on the values
of Rand C. If then the total impedance is 
and the phase shift is given by
(9.70)
This shows that the amount of phase shift depends on the values of R,
C, and the operating frequency. Since the output voltage across theresistor is in phase with the current, leads (positive phase shift) as shown in Fig. 9.32(a).
In Fig. 9.31(b), the output is taken across the capacitor. The cur-
rent Ileads the input voltage by but the output voltage across
the capacitor lags (negative phase shift) the input voltage as illus-trated in Fig. 9.32(b).v

We should keep in mind that the simple RCcircuits in Fig. 9.31
also act as voltage dividers. Therefore, as the phase shift approaches
the output voltage approaches zero. For this reason, these
simple RCcircuits are used only when small amounts of phase shift
are required. If it is desired to have phase shifts greater than 
simple RCnetworks are cascaded, thereby providing a total phase
shift equal to the sum of the individual phase shifts. In practice, thephase shifts due to the stages are not equal, because the succeedingstages load down the earlier stages unless op amps are used to sep-arate the stages.60/H11034,V

Solution:
If we select circuit components of equal ohmic value, say 
at a particular frequency, according to Eq. (9.70), the phase shift
is exactly By cascading two similar RCcircuits in Fig. 9.31(a), we
obtain the circuit in Fig. 9.33, providing a positive or leading phaseshift of as we shall soon show. Using the series-parallel combinationtechnique, Zin Fig. 9.33 is obtained as

9.8.2 AC Bridges
An ac bridge circuit is used in measuring the inductance Lof an
inductor or the capacitance C of a capacitor. It is similar in form to
the Wheatstone bridge for measuring an unknown resistance (dis-
cussed in Section 4.10) and follows the same principle. To measureLand C, however, an ac source is needed as well as an ac meter0.172, 120.4/H11034,Practice Problem 9.14

ammeter or voltmeter.
Consider the general ac bridge circuit displayed in Fig. 9.37. The
bridge is balanced when no current ﬂows through the meter. This
means that Applying the voltage division principle,

(b) remains the same as in Eq. (9.15.4) but and are in
parallel. Assuming an RCparallel combination,
By equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain
We have assumed a parallel RC combination which works in
this case.
5.Evaluate. Let us now use PSpice to see if we indeed have the
correct equalities. Running PSpice with the equivalent circuits,
an open circuit between the “bridge” portion of the circuit,
and a 10-volt input voltage yields the following voltages at theends of the “bridge” relative to a reference at the bottom ofthe circuit:
FREQ VM($N_0002) VP($N_0002)
2.000E+03 9.993E+00 -8.634E-03
2.000E+03 9.993E+00 -8.637E-03
Since the voltages are essentially the same, then no measurable
current can ﬂow through the “bridge” portion of the circuit forany element that connects the two points together and we have abalanced bridge, which is to be expected. This indicates we haveproperly determined the unknowns.
There is a very important problem with what we have done!
Do you know what that is? We have what can be called anideal, “theoretical” answer, but one that really is not very goodin the real world. The difference between the magnitudes of theupper impedances and the lower impedances is much too largeand would never be accepted in a real bridge circuit. Forgreatest accuracy, the overall magnitude of the impedances mustat least be within the same relative order. To increase theaccuracy of the solution of this problem, I would recommendincreasing the magnitude of the top impedances to be in therange of to One additional real-world comment:the size of these impedances also creates serious problems inmaking actual measurements, so the appropriate instrumentsmust be used in order to minimize their loading (which wouldchange the actual voltage readings) on the circuit.
6.Satisfactory? Since we solved for the unknown terms and then
tested to see if they woked, we validated the results. They cannow be presented as a solution to the problem.1.5 M/H9024. 500 k/H9024 /H11005/H11002

Summary
1. A sinusoid is a signal in the form of the sine or cosine function.
It has the general form
where is the amplitude, is the angular frequency,
is the argument, and is the phase.
2. A phasor is a complex quantity that represents both the magni-
tude and the phase of a sinusoid. Given the sinusoid 
its phasor V is
3. In ac circuits, voltage and current phasors always have a ﬁxed
relation to one another at any moment of time. If 
represents the voltage through an element and
represents the current through the element,
then if the element is a resistor, leads by if the
element is a capacitor, and lags by if the element is aninductor.
4. The impedance Z of a circuit is the ratio of the phasor voltage
across it to the phasor current through it:
The admittance Y is the reciprocal of impedance:
Impedances are combined in series or in parallel the same way as
resistances in series or parallel; that is, impedances in series addwhile admittances in parallel add.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Software Engineering
Software engineering is that aspect of engineering that deals with thepractical application of scientiﬁc knowledge in the design, construction,and validation of computer programs and the associated documentationrequired to develop, operate, and maintain them. It is a branch of elec-trical engineering that is becoming increasingly important as more andmore disciplines require one form of software package or another to per-form routine tasks and as programmable microelectronic systems areused in more and more applications.
The role of a software engineer should not be confused with
that of a computer scientist; the software engineer is a practitioner,not a theoretician. A software engineer should have good computer-programming skills and be familiar with programming languages, inparticular which is becoming increasingly popular. Because hard-ware and software are closely interlinked, it is essential that a softwareengineer have a thorough understanding of hardware design. Mostimportant, the software engineer should have some specialized knowl-edge of the area in which the software development skill is to beapplied.
All in all, the ﬁeld of software engineering offers a great career to
those who enjoy programming and developing software packages. Thehigher rewards will go to those having the best preparation, with themost interesting and challenging opportunities going to those withgraduate education.C

Introduction 
In Chapter 9, we learned that the forced or steady-state response of cir-
cuits to sinusoidal inputs can be obtained by using phasors. We alsoknow that Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws are applicable to ac circuits. Inthis chapter, we want to see how nodal analysis, mesh analysis,Thevenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem, superposition, and source trans-formations are applied in analyzing ac circuits. Since these techniqueswere already introduced for dc circuits, our major effort here will beto illustrate with examples.
Analyzing ac circuits usually requires three steps.10.1414 Chapter 10 Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
Steps to Analyze AC Circuits:
1. Transform the circuit to the phasor or frequency domain.
2. Solve the problem using circuit techniques (nodal analysis,
mesh analysis, superposition, etc.).
3. Transform the resulting phasor to the time domain.
Step 1 is not necessary if the problem is speciﬁed in the frequencydomain. In step 2, the analysis is performed in the same manner as dccircuit analysis except that complex numbers are involved. Having readChapter 9, we are adept at handling step 3.
Toward the end of the chapter, we learn how to apply PSpice in
solving ac circuit problems. We ﬁnally apply ac circuit analysis to twopractical ac circuits: oscillators and ac transistor circuits.
Nodal Analysis
The basis of nodal analysis is Kirchhoff’s current law. Since KCL isvalid for phasors, as demonstrated in Section 9.6, we can analyze accircuits by nodal analysis. The following examples illustrate this.10.2Frequency domain analysis of an ac
circuit via phasors is much easierthan analysis of the circuit in thetime domain.

Mesh Analysis
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) forms the basis of mesh analysis. The
validity of KVL for ac circuits was shown in Section 9.6 and is illus-trated in the following examples. Keep in mind that the very nature ofusing mesh analysis is that it is to be applied to planar circuits.10.3V1/H1100538.72 l69.67/H11034  V, V 2/H110056.752 l165.7/H11034  V.
Example 10.3 Determine current in the circuit of Fig. 10.7 using mesh analysis.
Solution:
Applying KVL to mesh 1, we obtain

Superposition Theorem
Since ac circuits are linear, the superposition theorem applies to ac
circuits the same way it applies to dc circuits. The theorem becomesimportant if the circuit has sources operating at different frequencies.
In this case, since the impedances depend on frequency, we must havea different frequency domain circuit for each frequency. The totalresponse must be obtained by adding the individual responses in thetime domain. It is incorrect to try to add the responses in the phasor
or frequency domain. Why? Because the exponential factor isimplicit in sinusoidal analysis, and that factor would change for everyangular frequency It would therefore not make sense to add responsesat different frequencies in the phasor domain. Thus, when a circuit hassources operating at different frequencies, one must add the responsesdue to the individual frequencies in the time domain./H9275.e

way as they are to dc circuits. The only additional effort arises fromthe need to manipulate complex numbers. The frequency domain ver-sion of a Thevenin equivalent circuit is depicted in Fig. 10.20, wherea linear circuit is replaced by a voltage source in series with an imped-ance. The Norton equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10.21, wherea linear circuit is replaced by a current source in parallel with an imped-ance. Keep in mind that the two equivalent circuits are related as
(10.2)
just as in source transformation. is the open-circuit voltage while is the short-circuit current.
If the circuit has sources operating at different frequencies (see
Example 10.6, for example), the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuitmust be determined at each frequency. This leads to entirely differentequivalent circuits, one for each frequency, not one equivalent circuitwith equivalent sources and equivalent impedances.I

Op Amp AC Circuits
The three steps stated in Section 10.1 also apply to op amp circuits, as
long as the op amp is operating in the linear region. As usual, we willassume ideal op amps. (See Section 5.2.) As discussed in Chapter 5,the key to analyzing op amp circuits is to keep two important proper-ties of an ideal op amp in mind:
1. No current enters either of its input terminals.2. The voltage across its input terminals is zero.
The following examples will illustrate these ideas.10.710.7 Op Amp AC Circuits 431

AC Analysis Using PSpice
PSpice affords a big relief from the tedious task of manipulating com-
plex numbers in ac circuit analysis. The procedure for using PSpice for
ac analysis is quite similar to that required for dc analysis. The reader
should read Section D.5 in Appendix D for a review of PSpice con-
cepts for ac analysis. AC circuit analysis is done in the phasor or fre-quency domain, and all sources must have the same frequency.Although ac analysis with PSpice involves using AC Sweep, our
analysis in this chapter requires a single frequency The out-put ﬁle of PSpice contains voltage and current phasors. If necessary,
the impedances can be calculated using the voltages and currents in theoutput ﬁle.f/H11005/H9275/H208622p.10.810.8 AC Analysis Using PSpice 433

Find and in the circuit of Fig. 10.38.
Solution:
1.Deﬁne. In its present form, the problem is clearly stated. Again,
we must emphasize that time spent here will save lots of time
and expense later on! One thing that might have created aproblem for you is that, if the reference was missing for thisproblem, you would then need to ask the individual assigningV
2 V1 Example 10.14ale29559_ch10.qxd  07/08/2008  11:58 AM  Page 434

the problem where it is to be located. If you could not do that,
then you would need to assume where it should be and thenclearly state what you did and why you did it.
2.Present. The given circuit is a frequency domain circuit and the
unknown node voltages and are also frequency domainvalues. Clearly, we need a process to solve for these unknownsin the frequency domain.
3.Alternative. We have two direct alternative solution techniques
that we can easily use. We can do a straightforward nodalanalysis approach or use PSpice. Since this example is in a
section dedicated to using PSpice to solve problems, we will
usePSpice to ﬁnd and We can then use nodal analysis
to check the answer.
4.Attempt. The circuit in Fig. 10.35 is in the time domain, whereas
the one in Fig. 10.38 is in the frequency domain. Since we are notgiven a particular frequency and PSpice requires one, we select any
frequency consistent with the given impedances. For example, ifwe select the corresponding frequency is
Weobtain the values of the capacitance
and inductances Making these changes
results in the schematic in Fig. 10.39. To ease wiring, we have(L/H11005X

5.Evaluate. One of the most important lessons to be learned is
that when using programs such as PSpice you still need to
validate the answer. There are many opportunities for making amistake, including coming across an unknown “bug” in PSpice
that yields incorrect results.
So, how can we validate this solution? Obviously, we can
rework the entire problem with nodal analysis, and perhapsusing MATLAB , to see if we obtain the same results. There is
another way we will use here: write the nodal equations and
substitute the answers obtained in the PSpice solution, and see
if the nodal equations are satisﬁed.
The nodal equations for this circuit are given below. Note
we have substituted into the dependent source.
Now, to check the answer, we substitute the PSpice answers into
this.

Applications
The concepts learned in this chapter will be applied in later chapters
to calculate electric power and determine frequency response. The con-cepts are also used in analyzing coupled circuits, three-phase circuits,ac transistor circuits, ﬁlters, oscillators, and other ac circuits. In thissection, we apply the concepts to develop two practical ac circuits: thecapacitance multiplier and the sine wave oscillators.
10.9.1 Capacitance Multiplier
The op amp circuit in Fig. 10.41 is known as a capacitance multiplier ,
for reasons that will become obvious. Such a circuit is used in integrated-circuit technology to produce a multiple of a small physical capaci-tance Cwhen a large capacitance is needed. The circuit in Fig. 10.41
can be used to multiply capacitance values by a factor up to 1000.For example, a 10-pF capacitor can be made to behave like a 100-nFcapacitor.10.910.9 Applications 437

In Fig. 10.41, the ﬁrst op amp operates as a voltage follower, while
the second one is an inverting ampliﬁer. The voltage follower isolates
the capacitance formed by the circuit from the loading imposed by theinverting ampliﬁer. Since no current enters the input terminals of theop amp, the input current ﬂows through the feedback capacitor.Hence, at node 1,

(10.7)
Thus, by a proper selection of the values of and the op amp cir-
cuit in Fig. 10.41 can be made to produce an effective capacitancebetween the input terminal and ground, which is a multiple of the phys-ical capacitance C. The size of the effective capacitance is practically
limited by the inverted output voltage limitation. Thus, the larger thecapacitance multiplication, the smaller is the allowable input voltage toprevent the op amps from reaching saturation.
Asimilar op amp circuit can be designed to simulate inductance.
(See Prob. 10.89.) There is also an op amp circuit conﬁguration to cre-ate a resistance multiplier.R

10.9.2 Oscillators
We know that dc is produced by batteries. But how do we produce ac?
One way is using oscillators, which are circuits that convert dc to ac.10.9 Applications 439

Answer: 10 mF.R1/H1100510 k/H9024, R 2/H1100510 M/H9024, and C /H1100510 nF.Practice Problem 10.15
An oscillator is a circuit that produces an ac waveform as output when
powered by a dc input.
The only external source an oscillator needs is the dc power sup-
ply. Ironically, the dc power supply is usually obtained by converting
the ac supplied by the electric utility company to dc. Having gonethrough the trouble of conversion, one may wonder why we need touse the oscillator to convert the dc to ac again. The problem is that theac supplied by the utility company operates at a preset frequency of60 Hz in the United States (50 Hz in some other nations), whereasmany applications such as electronic circuits, communication systems,and microwave devices require internally generated frequencies thatrange from 0 to 10 GHz or higher. Oscillators are used for generatingthese frequencies.
In order for sine wave oscillators to sustain oscillations, they must
meet the Barkhausen criteria:
1. The overall gain of the oscillator must be unity or greater. There-
fore, losses must be compensated for by an amplifying device.
2. The overall phase shift (from input to output and back to the input)
must be zero.
Three common types of sine wave oscillators are phase-shift, twin T , and
Wien-bridge oscillators. Here we consider only the Wien-bridge oscillator.
The Wien-bridge oscillator is widely used for generating sinusoids
in the frequency range below 1 MHz. It is an RCop amp circuit with
only a few components, easily tunable and easy to design. As shownin Fig. 10.42, the oscillator essentially consists of a noninverting ampli-ﬁer with two feedback paths: the positive feedback path to the nonin-verting input creates oscillations, while the negative feedback path tothe inverting input controls the gain. If we deﬁne the impedances ofthe RCseries and parallel combinations as and then

Substituting Eqs. (10.8) and (10.9) into Eq. (10.10) gives
(10.11)
To satisfy the second Barkhausen criterion, must be in phase with
which implies that the ratio in Eq. (10.11) must be purely real.
Hence, the imaginary part must be zero. Setting the imaginary part
equal to zero gives the oscillation frequency as

(10.13)
or
(10.14)
Substituting Eq. (10.13) and into Eq. (10.11)
yields
(10.15)
Thus, in order to satisfy the ﬁrst Barkhausen criterion, the op amp must
compensate by providing a gain of 3 or greater so that the overall gainis at least 1 or unity. We recall that for a noninverting ampliﬁer,
(10.16)
or
(10.17)
Due to the inherent delay caused by the op amp, Wien-bridge oscil-
lators are limited to operating in the frequency range of 1 MHz or less.R

Summary
1. We apply nodal and mesh analysis to ac circuits by applying KCL
and KVL to the phasor form of the circuits.
2. In solving for the steady-state response of a circuit that has inde-
pendent sources with different frequencies, each independent
source must be considered separately. The most natural approach
to analyzing such circuits is to apply the superposition theorem. Aseparate phasor circuit for each frequency must be solved inde-
pendently, and the corresponding response should be obtained inthe time domain. The overall response is the sum of the timedomain responses of all the individual phasor circuits.
3. The concept of source transformation is also applicable in the fre-
quency domain.
4.The Thevenin equivalent of an ac circuit consists of a voltagesource in series with the Thevenin impedance 
5. The Norton equivalent of an ac circuit consists of a current source
in parallel with the Norton impedance 
6.PSpice is a simple and powerful tool for solving ac circuit prob-
lems. It relieves us of the tedious task of working with the com-plex numbers involved in steady-state analysis.
7. The capacitance multiplier and the ac oscillator provide two typi-
cal applications for the concepts presented in this chapter. A capac-itance multiplier is an op amp circuit used in producing a multipleof a physical capacitance. An oscillator is a device that uses a dcinput to generate an ac output.Z

Career in Power Systems
The discovery of the principle of an ac generator by Michael Faradayin 1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering; it provided a con-venient way of generating the electric power that is needed in everyelectronic, electrical, or electromechanical device we use now.
Electric power is obtained by converting energy from sources such
as fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal), nuclear fuel (uranium), hydro energy(water falling through a head), geothermal energy (hot water, steam),wind energy, tidal energy, and biomass energy (wastes). These variousways of generating electric power are studied in detail in the ﬁeld ofpower engineering, which has become an indispensable subdisciplineof electrical engineering. An electrical engineer should be familiar withthe analysis, generation, transmission, distribution, and cost of electricpower.
The electric power industry is a very large employer of electrical
engineers. The industry includes thousands of electric utility systemsranging from large, interconnected systems serving large regional areasto small power companies serving individual communities or factories.Due to the complexity of the power industry, there are numerous elec-trical engineering jobs in different areas of the industry: power plant(generation), transmission and distribution, maintenance, research, dataacquisition and ﬂow control, and management. Since electric power isused everywhere, electric utility companies are everywhere, offeringexciting training and steady employment for men and women in thou-sands of communities throughout the world.

Introduction
Our effort in ac circuit analysis so far has been focused mainly on cal-
culating voltage and current. Our major concern in this chapter ispower analysis.
Power analysis is of paramount importance. Power is the most
important quantity in electric utilities, electronic, and communicationsystems, because such systems involve transmission of power from onepoint to another. Also, every industrial and household electricaldevice—every fan, motor, lamp, pressing iron, TV , personal computer—has a power rating that indicates how much power the equipmentrequires; exceeding the power rating can do permanent damage to anappliance. The most common form of electric power is 50- or 60-Hzac power. The choice of ac over dc allowed high-voltage power trans-mission from the power generating plant to the consumer.
We will begin by deﬁning and deriving instantaneous power and
average power . We will then introduce other power concepts. As prac-
tical applications of these concepts, we will discuss how power ismeasured and reconsider how electric utility companies charge theircustomers.
Instantaneous and Average Power
As mentioned in Chapter 2, the instantaneous power p(t) absorbed by
an element is the product of the instantaneous voltage v(t) across the
element and the instantaneous current i(t) through it. Assuming the pas-
sive sign convention,
(11.1) p(t)/H11005v(t)i(t)11.211.1458 Chapter 11 AC Power Analysis
The instantaneous power (in watts) is the power at any instant of time.
It is the rate at which an element absorbs energy.
Consider the general case of instantaneous power absorbed by an
arbitrary combination of circuit elements under sinusoidal excitation,as shown in Fig. 11.1. Let the voltage and current at the terminals ofthe circuit be
(11.2a)
(11.2b)
where and are the amplitudes (or peak values), and and arethe phase angles of the voltage and current, respectively. The instanta-neous power absorbed by the circuit is

power as the power absorbed by the
element at a speciﬁc instant of time.Instantaneous quantities are denotedby lowercase letters.

and express Eq. (11.3) as
(11.5)
This shows us that the instantaneous power has two parts. The ﬁrst part
is constant or time independent. Its value depends on the phase differ-ence between the voltage and the current. The second part is a sinu-soidal function whose frequency is which is twice the angularfrequency of the voltage or current.
Asketch of p (t) in Eq. (11.5) is shown in Fig. 11.2, where 
is the period of voltage or current. We observe that p(t) is peri-
odic, and has a period of since its fre-
quency is twice that of voltage or current. We also observe that p(t)
is positive for some part of each cycle and negative for the rest ofthe cycle. When p(t) is positive, power is absorbed by the circuit.
When p(t) is negative, power is absorbed by the source; that is,
power is transferred from the circuit to the source. This is possiblebecause of the storage elements (capacitors and inductors) in thecircuit.T

The average power, in watts, is the average of the instantaneous power
over one period.
Thus, the average power is given by
(11.6)
Although Eq. (11.6) shows the averaging done over T, we would get
the same result if we performed the integration over the actual period
of p(t) which is T 0/H11005T/H208622.P/H110051

The instantaneous power changes with time and is therefore difﬁ-
cult to measure. The average power is more convenient to measure. In
fact, the wattmeter, the instrument for measuring power, responds to
average power.ale29559_ch11.qxd  07/08/2008  12:01 PM  Page 459

Substituting p(t) in Eq. (11.5) into Eq. (11.6) gives
(11.7)
The ﬁrst integrand is constant, and the average of a constant is the same
constant. The second integrand is a sinusoid. We know that the aver-age of a sinusoid over its period is zero because the area under thesinusoid during a positive half-cycle is canceled by the area under itduring the following negative half-cycle. Thus, the second term inEq. (11.7) vanishes and the average power becomes
(11.8)
Since what is important is the difference
in the phases of the voltage and current.
Note that p (t) is time-varying while P does not depend on time. To
ﬁnd the instantaneous power, we must necessarily have v(t) and i (t) in
the time domain. But we can ﬁnd the average power when voltage andcurrent are expressed in the time domain, as in Eq. (11.8), or when theyare expressed in the frequency domain. The phasor forms of v(t) and i (t)
in Eq. (11.2) are and respectively. Pis calculated
using Eq. (11.8) or using phasors Vand I. To use phasors, we notice that
(11.9)
We recognize the real part of this expression as the average power P
according to Eq. (11.8). Thus,
(11.10)
Consider two special cases of Eq. (11.10). When the volt-
age and current are in phase. This implies a purely resistive circuit orresistive load and
(11.11)
where Equation (11.11) shows that a purely resistive cir-
cuit absorbs power at all times. When we have a purely
reactive circuit, and

Maximum Average Power Transfer
In Section 4.8 we solved the problem of maximizing the power deliv-
ered by a power-supplying resistive network to a load Represent-ing the circuit by its Thevenin equivalent, we proved that themaximum power would be delivered to the load if the load resistanceis equal to the Thevenin resistance We now extend thatresult to ac circuits.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 11.7, where an ac circuit is connected
to a load and is represented by its Thevenin equivalent. The load isusually represented by an impedance, which may model an electricZ

Thevenin impedance and the load impedance are

(11.13b)
The current through the load is
(11.14)
From Eq. (11.11), the average power delivered to the load is
(11.15)
Our objective is to adjust the load parameters and so that Pis
maximum. To do this we set and equal to zero. FromEq. (11.15), we obtain

Effective or RMS Value
The idea of effective value arises from the need to measure the effective-
ness of a voltage or current source in delivering power to a resistive load.11.4
The effective value of a periodic current is the dc current that deliv-
ers the same average power to a resistor as the periodic current.ale29559_ch11.qxd  07/08/2008  12:01 PM  Page 467

In Fig. 11.13, the circuit in (a) is ac while that of (b) is dc. Our objective
is to ﬁnd that will transfer the same power to resistor Ras the sinu-
soid i. The average power absorbed by the resistor in the ac circuit is
(11.22)
while the power absorbed by the resistor in the dc circuit is
(11.23)
Equating the expressions in Eqs. (11.22) and (11.23) and solving for
, we obtain
(11.24)
The effective value of the voltage is found in the same way as current;that is,
(11.25)
This indicates that the effective value is the (square) r ootof the mean
(or average) of the square of the periodic signal. Thus, the effective
value is often known as the root-mean-square value, or rms value for
short; and we write
(11.26)

values.

Similarly, the average power absorbed by a resistor R in Eq. (11.11)

When a sinusoidal voltage or current is speciﬁed, it is often in terms
of its maximum (or peak) value or its rms value, since its average value
is zero. The power industries specify phasor magnitudes in terms of theirrms values rather than peak values. For instance, the 110 V available atevery household is the rms value of the voltage from the power com-pany. It is convenient in power analysis to express voltage and currentin their rms values. Also, analog voltmeters and ammeters are designedto read directly the rms value of voltage and current, respectively.P/H11005I

The average power is a product of two terms. The product is
known as the apparent power S. The factor is called the
power factor (pf).cos(u v/H11002ui)Vrms  Irms11.5 Apparent Power and Power Factor 471
The apparent power is so called because it seems apparent that the powershould be the voltage-current product, by analogy with dc resistive cir-cuits. It is measured in volt-amperes or V A to distinguish it from theaverage or real power, which is measured in watts. The power factor isdimensionless, since it is the ratio of the average power to the apparentpower,
(11.36)
The angle is called the power factor angle, since it is the
angle whose cosine is the power factor. The power factor angle is equalto the angle of the load impedance if V is the voltage across the load
and Iis the current through it. This is evident from the fact that

age and current.
The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between volt-
age and current. It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance.
From Eq. (11.36), the power factor may be seen as that factor by which
the apparent power must be multiplied to obtain the real or averagepower. The value of pf ranges between zero and unity. For a purelyresistive load, the voltage and current are in phase, so that and . This implies that the apparent power is equal to the aver-age power. For a purely reactive load, and . Inthis case the average power is zero. In between these two extremecases, pf is said to be leading or lagging . Leading power factor means
that current leads voltage, which implies a capacitive load. Laggingpower factor means that current lags voltage, implying an inductivepf/H110050 u

Complex Power
Considerable effort has been expended over the years to express
power relations as simply as possible. Power engineers have coinedthe term complex power, which they use to ﬁnd the total effect ofparallel loads. Complex power is important in power analysis becauseit contains all the information pertaining to the power absorbed by a
given load.
Consider the ac load in Fig. 11.20. Given the phasor form 
and of voltage and current the complex
power Sabsorbed by the ac load is the product of the voltage and the
complex conjugate of the current, or
(11.40)

Thus we may write Eq. (11.41) as
(11.44)
This equation can also be obtained from Eq. (11.9). We notice from
Eq. (11.44) that the magnitude of the complex power is the apparentpower; hence, the complex power is measured in volt-amperes (V A). Also,we notice that the angle of the complex power is the power factor angle.
The complex power may be expressed in terms of the load imped-
ance Z. From Eq. (11.37), the load impedance Zmay be written as
(11.45)
Thus, Substituting this into Eq. (11.41) gives
(11.46)
Since Eq. (11.46) becomes
(11.47)
where Pand Qare the real and imaginary parts of the complex power;
that is,
(11.48)
(11.49)
Pis the average or real power and it depends on the load’s resistance
R. Q depends on the load’s reactance Xand is called the r eactive (or
quadrature) power.
Comparing Eq. (11.44) with Eq. (11.47), we notice that
(11.50)
The real power P is the average power in watts delivered to a load; it
is the only useful power. It is the actual power dissipated by the load.
The reactive power Q is a measure of the energy exchange between the
source and the reactive part of the load. The unit of Qis the volt-ampere
reactive (V AR) to distinguish it from the real power, whose unit is the
watt. We know from Chapter 6 that energy storage elements neither dis-sipate nor supply power, but exchange power back and forth with therest of the network. In the same way, the reactive power is being trans-ferred back and forth between the load and the source. It represents alossless interchange between the load and the source. Notice that:

When working with the rms values of
currents or voltages, we may drop thesubscript rms if no confusion will becaused by doing so.
Complex power (in VA) is the product of the rms voltage phasor and
the complex conjugate of the rms current phasor. As a complex quantity,
its real part is real power Pand its imaginary part is reactive power Q.ale29559_ch11.qxd  07/08/2008  12:01 PM  Page 474

Introducing the complex power enables us to obtain the real and reac-
tive powers directly from voltage and current phasors.
(11.51)
This shows how the complex power contains allthe relevant power
information in a given load.
It is a standard practice to represent S, P, and Q in the form of a
triangle, known as the power triangle, shown in Fig. 11.21(a). This is
similar to the impedance triangle showing the relationship between Z,
R, and X , illustrated in Fig. 11.21(b). The power triangle has four
items—the apparent/complex power, real power, reactive power, andthe power factor angle. Given two of these items, the other two caneasily be obtained from the triangle. As shown in Fig. 11.22, when S
lies in the ﬁrst quadrant, we have an inductive load and a lagging pf.When Slies in the fourth quadrant, the load is capacitive and the pf is
leading. It is also possible for the complex power to lie in the secondor third quadrant. This requires that the load impedance have a nega-tive resistance, which is possible with active circuits.Power Factor /H11005P

Conservation of AC Power
The principle of conservation of power applies to ac circuits as well as
to dc circuits (see Section 1.5).
To see this, consider the circuit in Fig. 11.23(a), where two load
impedances and are connected in parallel across an ac source V.
KCL gives

If the loads are connected in series with the voltage source, as

The complex power supplied by the source is
(11.55)
where and denote the complex powers delivered to loads and

We conclude from Eqs. (11.53) and (11.55) that whether the loads
are connected in series or in parallel (or in general), the total power
supplied by the source equals the total power delivered to the load.
Thus, in general, for a source connected to Nloads,
(11.56)
This means that the total complex power in a network is the sum ofthe complex powers of the individual components. (This is also true ofreal power and reactive power, but not true of apparent power.) Thisexpresses the principle of conservation of ac power:S/H11005S

In fact, all forms of ac power are con-
served: instantaneous, real, reactive,and complex.
The complex, real, and reactive powers of the sources equal the
respective sums of the complex, real, and reactive powers of the indi-vidual loads.
From this we imply that the real (or reactive) power ﬂow from sources
in a network equals the real (or reactive) power ﬂow into the other ele-ments in the network.

Power Factor Correction
Most domestic loads (such as washing machines, air conditioners, and
refrigerators) and industrial loads (such as induction motors) are induc-tive and operate at a low lagging power factor. Although the inductivenature of the load cannot be changed, we can increase its power factor.11.811.8 Power Factor Correction 481
The process of increasing the power factor without altering the voltage
or current to the original load is known as power factor correction.
Since most loads are inductive, as shown in Fig. 11.27(a), a load’s
power factor is improved or corrected by deliberately installing a
capacitor in parallel with the load, as shown in Fig. 11.27(b). The effectof adding the capacitor can be illustrated using either the power trian-gle or the phasor diagram of the currents involved. Figure 11.28 showsthe latter, where it is assumed that the circuit in Fig. 11.27(a) has apower factor of while the one in Fig. 11.27(b) has a power fac-tor of It is evident from Fig. 11.28 that adding the capacitor hascaused the phase angle between the supplied voltage and current toreduce from to thereby increasing the power factor. We alsonotice from the magnitudes of the vectors in Fig. 11.28 that with thesame supplied voltage, the circuit in Fig. 11.27(a) draws larger current
than the current I drawn by the circuit in Fig. 11.27(b). Power com-
panies charge more for larger currents, because they result in increasedpower losses (by a squared factor, since ). Therefore, it is ben-eﬁcial to both the power company and the consumer that every effortis made to minimize current level or keep the power factor as close tounity as possible. By choosing a suitable size for the capacitor, the cur-rent can be made to be completely in phase with the voltage, imply-ing unity power factor.P/H11005I

may be viewed as the addition of a re-active element (usually a capacitor) inparallel with the load in order to makethe power factor closer to unity.

If we desire to increase the power factor from to without
altering the real power (i.e., ), then the new reactive power is
(11.58)
The reduction in the reactive power is caused by the shunt capacitor;that is,
(11.59)
But from Eq. (11.46), The value of therequired shunt capacitance C is determined as
(11.60)
Note that the real power P dissipated by the load is not affected by the
power factor correction because the average power due to the capaci-tance is zero.
Although the most common situation in practice is that of an
inductive load, it is also possible that the load is capacitive; that is, theload is operating at a leading power factor. In this case, an inductorshould be connected across the load for power factor correction. Therequired shunt inductance Lcan be calculated from

Answer: 30.69 mF.Practice Problem 11.15
Applications
In this section, we consider two important application areas: how power
is measured and how electric utility companies determine the cost ofelectricity consumption.
11.9.1 Power Measurement
The average power absorbed by a load is measured by an instrumentcalled the wattmeter.11.9
The wattmeter is the instrument for measuring the average power.
Figure 11.30 shows a wattmeter that consists essentially of two
coils: the current coil and the voltage coil. A current coil with very low
impedance (ideally zero) is connected in series with the load (Fig. 11.31)and responds to the load current. The voltage coil with very high imped-ance (ideally inﬁnite) is connected in parallel with the load as shown
in Fig. 11.31 and responds to the load voltage. The current coil actslike a short circuit because of its low impedance; the voltage coilReactive power is measured by an
instrument called the varmeter. The
varmeter is often connected to theload in the same way as the wattmeter.
Some wattmeters do not have coils;
the wattmeter considered here is theelectromagnetic type.ale29559_ch11.qxd  07/08/2008  12:02 PM  Page 483

behaves like an open circuit because of its high impedance. As a result,
the presence of the wattmeter does not disturb the circuit or have aneffect on the power measurement.
When the two coils are energized, the mechanical inertia of the mov-
ingsystem produces a deﬂection angle that is proportional to the aver-
age value of the product If the current and voltage of the loadare and their corre-sponding rms phasors are
(11.62)
and the wattmeter measures the average power given by
(11.63)
As shown in Fig. 11.31, each wattmeter coil has two terminals with
one marked To ensure upscale deﬂection, the terminal of the cur-rent coil is toward the source, while the terminal of the voltage coilis connected to the same line as the current coil. Reversing both coilconnections still results in upscale deﬂection. However, reversing onecoil and not the other results in downscale deﬂection and no wattmeterreading./H11006/H11006 /H11006.P/H11005|V

Solution:
1.Deﬁne. The problem is clearly deﬁned. Interestingly, this is a
problem where the student could actually validate the results by
doing the problem in the laboratory with a real wattmeter.ale29559_ch11.qxd  07/08/2008  12:02 PM  Page 484

2.Present. This problem consists of ﬁnding the average power
delivered to a load by an external source with a series impedance.
3.Alternative. This is a straightforward circuit problem where all
we need to do is ﬁnd the magnitude and phase of the current
through the load and the magnitude and the phase of the voltageacross the load. These quantities could also be found by usingPSpice, which we will use as a check.
4.Attempt. In Fig. 11.32, the wattmeter reads the average power
absorbed by the impedance because the current coilis in series with the impedance while the voltage coil is inparallel with it. The current through the circuit is
The voltage across the impedance is
The complex power is
The wattmeter reads

11.9.2 Electricity Consumption Cost
In Section 1.7, we considered a simpliﬁed model of the way the cost of
electricity consumption is determined. But the concept of power factorwas not included in the calculations. Now we consider the importanceof power factor in electricity consumption cost.
Loads with low power factors are costly to serve because they
require large currents, as explained in Section 11.8. The ideal situa-tion would be to draw minimum current from a supply so that 
and . A load with nonzero Qmeans that energy ﬂows
back and forth between the load and the source, giving rise to addi-tional power losses. In view of this, power companies often encour-age their customers to have power factors as close to unity as possibleand penalize some customers who do not improve their load powerfactors.
Utility companies divide their customers into categories: as resi-
dential (domestic), commercial, and industrial, or as small power,medium power, and large power. They have different rate structures foreach category. The amount of energy consumed in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh) is measured using a kilowatt-hour meter installed at thecustomer’s premises.
Although utility companies use different methods for charging cus-
tomers, the tariff or charge to a consumer is often two-part. The ﬁrstpart is ﬁxed and corresponds to the cost of generation, transmission,and distribution of electricity to meet the load requirements of the con-sumers. This part of the tariff is generally expressed as a certain pricepf/H110051 P, Q /H110050,S/H11005ale29559_ch11.qxd  07/08/2008  12:02 PM  Page 486

per kW of maximum demand. Or it may be based on kV A of maxi-
mum demand, to account for the power factor (pf) of the consumer. Apf penalty charge may be imposed on the consumer whereby a certainpercentage of kW or kV A maximum demand is charged for every 0.01fall in pf below a prescribed value, say 0.85 or 0.9. On the other hand,a pf credit may be given for every 0.01 that the pf exceeds the pre-scribed value.
The second part is proportional to the energy consumed in kWh;
it may be in graded form, for example, the ﬁrst 100 kWh at 16 cents/kWh,the next 200 kWh at 10 cents/kWh and so forth. Thus, the bill is deter-mined based on the following equation:
(11.64) Total Cost /H11005Fixed Cost /H11001Cost of Energy11.9 Applications 487
Amanufacturing industry consumes 200 MWh in one month. If the
maximum demand is 1600 kW, calculate the electricity bill based on
the following two-part rate:
Demand charge: $5.00 per month per kW of billing demand.Energy charge: 8 cents per kWh for the ﬁrst 50,000 kWh,
5cents per kWh for the remaining energy.
Solution:The demand charge is
(11.17.1)
The energy charge for the ﬁrst 50,000 kWh is
(11.17.2)
The remaining energy is and the corresponding energy charge is
(11.17.3)
Adding the results of Eqs. (11.17.1) to (11.17.3) gives
It may appear that the cost of electricity is too high. But this is often a
small fraction of the overall cost of production of the goods manufacturedor the selling price of the ﬁnished product.Total bill for the month /H11005$8000 /H11001$4000 /H11001$7500 /H11005$19,500$0.05 /H11003150,000 /H11005$7500200,000 kWh /H1100250,000 kWh /H11005150,000 kWh,$0.08 /H1100350,000 /H11005$4000$5.00 /H110031600 /H11005$8000Example 11.17

A300-kW load supplied at 13 kV (rms) operates 520 hours a month
at 80 percent power factor. Calculate the average cost per month based
on this simpliﬁed tariff:
Energy charge: 6 cents per kWhPower-factor penalty: 0.1 percent of energy charge for every 0.01
that pf falls below 0.85.
Power-factor credit: 0.1 percent of energy charge for every 0.01
that pf exceeds 0.85.
Solution:The energy consumed is
The operating power factor is below the
prescribed power factor of 0.85. Since there is 0.1 percent energy chargefor every 0.01, there is a power-factor penalty charge of 0.5 percent.This amounts to an energy charge of

Inductors and capacitors absorb no average power, while the aver-
age power absorbed by a resistor is 
3. Maximum average power is transferred to a load when the load
impedance is the complex conjugate of the Thevenin impedanceas seen from the load terminals, 
4. The effective value of a periodic signal x(t) is its root-mean-square
(rms) value.
For a sinusoid, the effective or rms value is its amplitude divided
by 
5. The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between
voltage and current:
It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance or the ratio
of real power to apparent power. The pf is lagging if the currentlags voltage (inductive load) and is leading when the current leadsvoltage (capacitive load).
6. Apparent power S (in V A) is the product of the rms values of volt-
age and current:
It is also given by where P is the real
power and Q is reactive power.
7. Reactive power (in V AR) is:
8. Complex power S (in V A) is the product of the rms voltage pha-
sor and the complex conjugate of the rms current phasor. It is also
the complex sum of real power P and reactive power Q.
Also,
9. The total complex power in a network is the sum of the complex
powers of the individual components. Total real power and reac-tive power are also, respectively, the sums of the individual realpowers and the reactive powers, but the total apparent power isnot calculated by the process.
10. Power factor correction is necessary for economic reasons; it is the
process of improving the power factor of a load by reducing theoverall reactive power.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.e), “an ability to identify, formulate,
and solve engineering problems.”
Developing and enhancing your “ability to identify, formulate, andsolve engineering problems” is a primary focus of textbook. Follow-ing our six step problem-solving process is the best way to practicethis skill. Our recommendation is that you use this process wheneverpossible. You may be pleased to learn that this process works well fornonengineering courses.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (f), “an understanding of professional
and ethical responsibility.”
“An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility” is requiredof every engineer. To some extent, this understanding is very personalfor each of us. Let us identify some pointers to help you develop thisunderstanding. One of my favorite examples is that an engineer has theresponsibility to answer what I call the “unasked question.” Forinstance, assume that you own a car that has a problem with the trans-mission. In the process of selling that car, the prospective buyer asksyou if there is a problem in the right-front wheel bearing. You answerno. However, as an engineer, you are required to inform the buyer thatthere is a problem with the transmission without being asked.
Your responsibility both professionally and ethically is to perform
in a manner that does not harm those around you and to whom you areresponsible. Clearly, developing this capability will take time and matu-rity on your part. I recommend practicing this by looking for profes-sional and ethical components in your day-to-day activities.

Introduction
So far in this text, we have dealt with single-phase circuits. A single-phase
ac power system consists of a generator connected through a pair of wires(a transmission line) to a load. Figure 12.1(a) depicts a single-phase two-wire system, where is the rms magnitude of the source voltage and is the phase. What is more common in practice is a single-phase three-wire system, shown in Fig. 12.1(b). It contains two identical sources(equal magnitude and the same phase) that are connected to two loads bytwo outer wires and the neutral. For example, the normal household sys-tem is a single-phase three-wire system because the terminal voltageshave the same magnitude and the same phase. Such a system allows theconnection of both 120-V and 240-V appliances.f V

Single-phase systems: (a) two-wire type, (b) three-wire type.
Circuits or systems in which the ac sources operate at the same fre-
quency but different phases are known as polyphase. Figure 12.2 shows
a two-phase three-wire system, and Fig. 12.3 shows a three-phase four-
wire system. As distinct from a single-phase system, a two-phase systemis produced by a generator consisting of two coils placed perpendicularto each other so that the voltage generated by one lags the other by By the same token, a three-phase system is produced by a generator con-sisting of three sources having the same amplitude and frequency but outof phase with each other by Since the three-phase system is by farthe most prevalent and most economical polyphase system, discussion inthis chapter is mainly on three-phase systems.
Three-phase systems are important for at least three reasons. First,
nearly all electric power is generated and distributed in three-phase, atthe operating frequency of 60 Hz (or ) in the United
States or 50 Hz (or ) in some other parts of the world.
When one-phase or two-phase inputs are required, they are taken fromthe three-phase system rather than generated independently. Even whenmore than three phases are needed—such as in the aluminum industry,where 48 phases are required for melting purposes—they can be providedby manipulating the three phases supplied. Second, the instantaneouspower in a three-phase system can be constant (not pulsating), as wewill see in Section 12.7. This results in uniform power transmissionand less vibration of three-phase machines. Third, for the same amountof power, the three-phase system is more economical than the single-phase. The amount of wire required for a three-phase system is lessthan that required for an equivalent single-phase system.

We begin with a discussion of balanced three-phase voltages. Then
we analyze each of the four possible conﬁgurations of balanced three-
phase systems. We also discuss the analysis of unbalanced three-phasesystems. We learn how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze a bal-
anced or unbalanced three-phase system. Finally, we apply the conceptsdeveloped in this chapter to three-phase power measurement and resi-dential electrical wiring.
Balanced Three-Phase Voltages
Three-phase voltages are often produced with a three-phase ac gener-ator (or alternator) whose cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 12.4.The generator basically consists of a rotating magnet (called the r otor)
surrounded by a stationary winding (called the stator ). Three separate12.212.2 Balanced Three-Phase Voltages 505
Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Croatian-American engineer whose
inventions—among them the induction motor and the ﬁrst polyphase ac
power system—greatly inﬂuenced the settlement of the ac versus dc de-bate in favor of ac. He was also responsible for the adoption of 60 Hz asthe standard for ac power systems in the United States.
Born in Austria-Hungary (now Croatia), to a clergyman, Tesla had
an incredible memory and a keen afﬁnity for mathematics. He movedto the United States in 1884 and ﬁrst worked for Thomas Edison. Atthat time, the country was in the “battle of the currents” with GeorgeWestinghouse (1846–1914) promoting ac and Thomas Edison rigidly
leading the dc forces. Tesla left Edison and joined Westinghousebecause of his interest in ac. Through Westinghouse, Tesla gained thereputation and acceptance of his polyphase ac generation, transmission,and distribution system. He held 700 patents in his lifetime. His otherinventions include high-voltage apparatus (the tesla coil) and a wire-less transmission system. The unit of magnetic ﬂux density, the tesla,was named in honor of him.Historical

windings or coils with terminals and are physically
placed apart around the stator. Terminals a and for example,
stand for one of the ends of coils going into and the other end comingout of the page. As the rotor rotates, its magnetic ﬁeld “cuts” the ﬂuxfrom the three coils and induces voltages in the coils. Because the coilsare placed apart, the induced voltages in the coils are equal inmagnitude but out of phase by (Fig. 12.5). Since each coil can beregarded as a single-phase generator by itself, the three-phase genera-tor can supply power to both single-phase and three-phase loads.
Atypical three-phase system consists of three voltage sources con-
nected to loads by three or four wires (or transmission lines). (Three-phase current sources are very scarce.) A three-phase system isequivalent to three single-phase circuits. The voltage sources can beeither wye-connected as shown in Fig. 12.6(a) or delta-connected as inFig. 12.6(b).120/H11034120/H11034a¿, 120/H11034c-c¿ a-a¿, b-b ¿,

As a common tradition in power
systems, voltage and current in thischapter are in rms values unlessotherwise stated.
Reminder : As time increases, each
phasor (or sinor) rotates at an angular
velocity . /H9275The phase sequence is the time order in which the voltages pass
through their respective maximum values.
The phase sequence is determined by the order in which the phasors
pass through a ﬁxed point in the phase diagram.
In Fig. 12.7(a), as the phasors rotate in the counterclockwise
direction with frequency they pass through the horizontal axis in asequence Thus, the sequence is abcor bcaor cab. Sim-
ilarly, for the phasors in Fig. 12.7(b), as they rotate in the counter-clockwise direction, they pass the horizontal axis in a sequence
This describes the acb sequence. The phase sequence is
important in three-phase power distribution. It determines the direc-tion of the rotation of a motor connected to the power source, forexample.
Like the generator connections, a three-phase load can be either
wye-connected or delta-connected, depending on the end application.Figure 12.8(a) shows a wye-connected load, and Fig. 12.8(b) shows adelta-connected load. The neutral line in Fig. 12.8(a) may or may notbe there, depending on whether the system is four- or three-wire. (And,of course, a neutral connection is topologically impossible for a deltaconnection.) A wye- or delta-connected load is said to be unbalanced
if the phase impedances are not equal in magnitude or phase.acbacba . . . .abcabca  . . . ./H9275, The phase sequence may also be re-

Eq. (9.69) that

so we know that a wye-connected load can be transformed into a delta-connected load, or vice versa, using Eq. (12.8).
Since both the three-phase source and the three-phase load can be
either wye- or delta-connected, we have four possible connections:
•Y-Y connection (i.e., Y-connected source with a Y-connected
load).
• connection.
• connection.
•- Y connection.
In subsequent sections, we will consider each of these possible con-ﬁgurations.
It is appropriate to mention here that a balanced delta-connected
load is more common than a balanced wye-connected load. This is dueto the ease with which loads may be added or removed from each phaseof a delta-connected load. This is very difﬁcult with a wye-connectedload because the neutral may not be accessible. On the other hand,delta-connected sources are not common in practice because of the cir-culating current that will result in the delta-mesh if the three-phase volt-ages are slightly unbalanced.¢¢-¢Y-¢Z

Balanced Wye-Wye Connection
We begin with the Y-Y system, because any balanced three-phase sys-
tem can be reduced to an equivalent Y-Y system. Therefore, analysis
of this system should be regarded as the key to solving all balancedthree-phase systems.12.312.3 Balanced Wye-Wye Connection 509
A balanced Y-Y system is a three-phase system with a balanced 
Y-connected source and a balanced Y-connected load.
Consider the balanced four-wire Y-Y system of Fig. 12.9, where a
Y-connected load is connected to a Y-connected source. We assume a
balanced load so that load impedances are equal. Although the imped-
ance is the total load impedance per phase, it may also be regardedas the sum of the source impedance line impedance and loadimpedance for each phase, since these impedances are in series. Asillustrated in Fig. 12.9, denotes the internal impedance of the phasewinding of the generator; is the impedance of the line joining aphase of the source with a phase of the load; is the impedance ofeach phase of the load; and is the impedance of the neutral line.Thus, in general

lumping the impedances together, the Y-Y system in Fig. 12.9 can besimpliﬁed to that shown in Fig. 12.10.

The line-to-line voltages or simply line voltages and are
related to the phase voltages. For example,
(12.11a)
Similarly, we can obtain
(12.11b)
(12.11c)
Thus, the magnitude of the line voltages is times the magnitude
of the phase voltages or
(12.12)
where
(12.13)
and
(12.14)
Also the line voltages lead their corresponding phase voltages by Figure 12.11(a) illustrates this. Figure 12.11(a) also shows how todetermine from the phase voltages, while Fig. 12.11(b) shows thesame for the three line voltages. Notice that leads by and
leads by so that the line voltages sum up to zero as do
the phase voltages.
Applying KVL to each phase in Fig. 12.10, we obtain the line cur-
rents as
(12.15)
We can readily infer that the line currents add up to zero,
(12.16)
so that

that is, the voltage across the neutral wire is zero. The neutral line canthus be removed without affecting the system. In fact, in long distancepower transmission, conductors in multiples of three are used with theearth itself acting as the neutral conductor. Power systems designed inthis way are well grounded at all critical points to ensure safety.
While the line current is the current in each line, the phase current
is the current in each phase of the source or load. In the Y-Y system, theline current is the same as the phase current. We will use single subscriptsV

for line currents because it is natural and conventional to assume that line
currents ﬂow from the source to the load.
An alternative way of analyzing a balanced Y-Y system is to do
so on a “per phase” basis. We look at one phase, say phase a, and ana-
lyze the single-phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.12. The single-phaseanalysis yields the line current as

From we use the phase sequence to obtain other line currents. Thus,as long as the system is balanced, we need only analyze one phase.Wemay do this even if the neutral line is absent, as in the three-wire

A balanced Y- system consists of a balanced Y-connected source
feeding a balanced -connected load. ¢¢
The balanced Y-delta system is shown in Fig. 12.14, where the
source is Y-connected and the load is -connected. There is, of course,
no neutral connection from source to load for this case. Assuming thepositive sequence, the phase voltages are again
(12.19)
As shown in Section 12.3, the line voltages are

showing that the line voltages are equal to the voltages across the loadimpedances for this system conﬁguration. From these voltages, we canobtain the phase currents as
(12.21)

Also, the line currents lag the corresponding phase currents by assuming the positive sequence. Figure 12.15 is a phasor diagram illus-trating the relationship between the phase and line currents.

the /H9004-connected load to an equivalent Y-connected load. Using the 
transformation formula in Eq. (12.8),

After this transformation, we now have a Y-Y system as in Fig. 12.10.The three-phase system in Fig. 12.14 can be replaced by the single-phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.16. This allows us to calculate onlythe line currents. The phase currents are obtained using Eq.

Balanced Delta-Delta Connection 12.5
A balanced system is one in which both the balanced source
and balanced load are -connected. ¢¢-¢
The source as well as the load may be delta-connected as shown
in Fig. 12.17. Our goal is to obtain the phase and line currents as usual.ale29559_ch12.qxd  07/22/2008  01:38 PM  Page 514
Assuming a positive sequence, the phase voltages for a delta-connected
source are
(12.29)
The line voltages are the same as the phase voltages. From Fig. 12.17,assuming there is no line impedances, the phase voltages of the delta-connected source are equal to the voltages across the impedances; that is,
(12.30)
Hence, the phase currents are
(12.31)
Since the load is delta-connected just as in the previous section, someof the formulas derived there apply here. The line currents are obtainedfrom the phase currents by applying KCL at nodes A,B, and C, as we
did in the previous section:
(12.32)
Also, as shown in the last section, each line current lags the correspond-ing phase current by the magnitude of the line current is timesthe magnitude of the phase current,

An alternative way of analyzing the circuit is to convert both
the source and the load to their Y equivalents. We already know that

Consider the circuit in Fig. 12.18. Again, assuming the abc

These are also the line voltages as well as the phase voltages.

But lags by since we assumed the abc sequence; that is,
Hence,
(12.36)
Substituting Eq. (12.36) into Eq. (12.35) gives
(12.37)
From this, we obtain the other line currents and using the posi-
tive phase sequence, i.e., The phase
currents are equal to the line currents.
Another way to obtain the line currents is to replace the delta-
connected source with its equivalent wye-connected source, as shownin Fig. 12.19. In Section 12.3, we found that the line-to-line voltagesof a wye-connected source lead their corresponding phase voltages by
Therefore, we obtain each phase voltage of the equivalent wye-
connected source by dividing the corresponding line voltage of thedelta-connected source by and shifting its phase by Thus,the equivalent wye-connected source has the phase voltages
(12.38)
If the delta-connected source has source impedance per phase, theequivalent wye-connected source will have a source impedance of per phase, according to Eq. (9.69).
Once the source is transformed to wye, the circuit becomes a wye-
wye system. Therefore, we can use the equivalent single-phase circuitshown in Fig. 12.20, from which the line current for phase ais

Alternatively, we may transform the wye-connected load to an
equivalent delta-connected load. This results in a delta-delta system,
which can be analyzed as in Section 12.5. Note that
(12.40)
As stated earlier, the delta-connected load is more desirable than
the wye-connected load. It is easier to alter the loads in any one phaseof the delta-connected loads, as the individual loads are connecteddirectly across the lines. However, the delta-connected source is hardlyused in practice, because any slight imbalance in the phase voltageswill result in unwanted circulating currents.

Power in a Balanced System
Let us now consider the power in a balanced three-phase system. We
begin by examining the instantaneous power absorbed by the load. Thisrequires that the analysis be done in the time domain. For a Y-connectedload, the phase voltages are
(12.41)
where the factor is necessary because has been deﬁned as the rmsvalue of the phase voltage. If the phase currents lag behindtheir corresponding phase voltages by Thus,

where is the rms value of the phase current. The total instantaneous
power in the load is the sum of the instantaneous powers in the threephases; that is,
(12.43)
Applying the trigonometric identity
(12.44)
gives
(12.45)
where 
Thus the total instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase system isconstant—it does not change with time as the instantaneous power ofeach phase does. This result is true whether the load is Y- or -connected.This is one important reason for using a three-phase system to generateand distribute power. We will look into another reason a little later.
Since the total instantaneous power is independent of time, the
average power per phase for either the -connected load or the Y-connected load is or
(12.46)
and the reactive power per phase is
(12.47)
The apparent power per phase is
(12.48)
The complex power per phase is
(12.49)
where and are the phase voltage and phase current with magni-tudes and respectively. The total average power is the sum of theaverage powers in the phases:

For a Y-connected load, but whereas for a

for both Y-connected and -connected loads. Similarly, the total reac-tive power is

Remember that and are all rms values and that is the
angle of the load impedance or the angle between the phase voltageand the phase current.
Asecond major advantage of three-phase systems for power dis-
tribution is that the three-phase system uses a lesser amount of wirethan the single-phase system for the same line voltage and the sameabsorbed power We will compare these cases and assume in boththat the wires are of the same material (e.g., copper with resistivity ),of the same length and that the loads are resistive (i.e., unity powerfactor). For the two-wire single-phase system in Fig. 12.21(a),

since Equation (12.58) shows that the single-phase systemuses 33 percent more material than the three-phase system or that thethree-phase system uses only 75 percent of the material used in theequivalent single-phase system. In other words, considerably less mate-rial is needed to deliver the same power with a three-phase system thanis required for a single-phase system.r

Refer to the circuit in Fig. 12.13 (in Example 12.2). Determine the total
average power, reactive power, and complex power at the source andat the load.
Solution:
It is sufﬁcient to consider one phase, as the system is balanced. Forphase a,
Thus, at the source, the complex power absorbed is
The real or average power absorbed is W and the reactive
power is V AR.
At the load, the complex power absorbed is

The real power absorbed is 1391.7 W and the reactive power absorbed
is 1113.3 V AR. The difference between the two complex powers isabsorbed by the line impedance To show that this is thecase, we ﬁnd the complex power absorbed by the line as

Answer: 46.31 A.Practice Problem 12.7
Two balanced loads are connected to a 240-kV rms 60-Hz line, as
shown in Fig. 12.22(a). Load 1 draws 30 kW at a power factor of 0.6
lagging, while load 2 draws 45 kV AR at a power factor of 0.8 lagging.Assuming the abc sequence, determine: (a) the complex, real, and reac-
tive powers absorbed by the combined load, (b) the line currents, and(c) the kV AR rating of the three capacitors -connected in parallel withthe load that will raise the power factor to 0.9 lagging and the capac-itance of each capacitor.

Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems
This chapter would be incomplete without mentioning unbalanced
three-phase systems. An unbalanced system is caused by two possiblesituations: (1) the source voltages are not equal in magnitude and/ordiffer in phase by angles that are unequal, or (2) load impedances areunequal. Thus,12.8
An unbalanced system is due to unbalanced voltage sources or an
unbalanced load.
To simplify analysis, we will assume balanced source voltages, but an
unbalanced load.
Unbalanced three-phase systems are solved by direct application
of mesh and nodal analysis. Figure 12.23 shows an example of an
unbalanced three-phase system that consists of balanced source volt-ages (not shown in the ﬁgure) and an unbalanced Y-connected load(shown in the ﬁgure). Since the load is unbalanced, and arenot equal. The line currents are determined by Ohm’s law as

This set of unbalanced line currents produces current in the neutral line,
which is not zero as in a balanced system. Applying KCL at node N
gives the neutral line current as
(12.60)
In a three-wire system where the neutral line is absent, we can still
ﬁnd the line currents and using mesh analysis. At node N,
KCL must be satisﬁed so that in this case. The samecould be done for an unbalanced -Y , Y- or three-wire system.As mentioned earlier, in long distance power transmission, conductorsin multiples of three (multiple three-wire systems) are used, with theearth itself acting as the neutral conductor.
To calculate power in an unbalanced three-phase system requires
that we ﬁnd the power in each phase using Eqs. (12.46) to (12.49). Thetotal power is not simply three times the power in one phase but thesum of the powers in the three phases.¢-¢ ¢ , ¢I

PSpice for Three-Phase Circuits
PSpice can be used to analyze three-phase balanced or unbalanced cir-
cuits in the same way it is used to analyze single-phase ac circuits.
However, a delta-connected source presents two major problems toPSpice. First, a delta-connected source is a loop of voltage sources—which PSpice does not like. To avoid this problem, we insert a resis-
tor of negligible resistance (say, per phase) into each phase ofthe delta-connected source. Second, the delta-connected source doesnot provide a convenient node for the ground node, which is necessaryto run PSpice. This problem can be eliminated by inserting balancedwye-connected large resistors (say, per phase) in the delta-connected source so that the neutral node of the wye-connected resis-tors serves as the ground node 0. Example 12.12 will illustrate this.1 M/H90241 m/H902412.912.9 PSpice for Three-Phase Circuits 529

Applications
Both wye and delta source connections have important practical appli-
cations. The wye source connection is used for long distance trans-mission of electric power, where resistive losses ( ) should be I

current the line current and the phase current I AB. IcC, Ica,ale29559_ch12.qxd  07/08/2008  12:05 PM  Page 534

minimal. This is due to the fact that the wye connection gives a line
voltage that is greater than the delta connection; hence, for thesame power, the line current is smaller. The delta source con-nection is used when three single-phase circuits are desired from athree-phase source. This conversion from three-phase to single-phaseis required in residential wiring, because household lighting andappliances use single-phase power. Three-phase power is used inindustrial wiring where a large power is required. In some applica-tions, it is immaterial whether the load is wye- or delta-connected.For example, both connections are satisfactory with induction motors.In fact, some manufacturers connect a motor in delta for 220 V andin wye for 440 V so that one line of motors can be readily adaptedto two different voltages.
Here we consider two practical applications of those concepts cov-
ered in this chapter: power measurement in three-phase circuits andresidential wiring.
12.10.1 Three-Phase Power Measurement
Section 11.9 presented the wattmeter as the instrument for measuringthe average (or real) power in single-phase circuits. A single wattmetercan also measure the average power in a three-phase system that is bal-anced, so that the total power is three times the read-ing of that one wattmeter. However, two or three single-phase wattmetersare necessary to measure power if the system is unbalanced. The three-
wattmeter method of power measurement, shown in Fig. 12.33, will
work regardless of whether the load is balanced or unbalanced, wye-or delta-connected. The three-wattmeter method is well suited forpower measurement in a three-phase system where the power factor isconstantly changing. The total average power is the algebraic sum ofthe three wattmeter readings,
(12.61)
where and correspond to the readings of wattmeters and respectively. Notice that the common or reference point o in
Fig. 12.33 is selected arbitrarily. If the load is wye-connected, point o
can be connected to the neutral point n. For a delta-connected load,
point ocan be connected to any point. If point ois connected to point
b, for example, the voltage coil in wattmeter reads zero and indicating that wattmeter is not necessary. Thus, two wattmeters aresufﬁcient to measure the total power.
The two-wattmeter method is the most commonly used method for
three-phase power measurement. The two wattmeters must be properlyconnected to any two phases, as shown typically in Fig. 12.34. Noticethat the current coil of each wattmeter measures the line current, whilethe respective voltage coil is connected between the line and the thirdline and measures the line voltage. Also notice that the terminal ofthe voltage coil is connected to the line to which the correspondingcurrent coil is connected.

We will show here that the method works for a balanced three-phase
system.
Consider the balanced, wye-connected load in Fig. 12.35. Our
objective is to apply the two-wattmeter method to ﬁnd the averagepower absorbed by the load. Assume the source is in the abcsequence
and the load impedance Due to the load impedance, each
voltage coil leads its current coil by so that the power factor is We recall that each line voltage leads the corresponding phase voltage
by Thus, the total phase difference between the phase current and line voltage is and the average power read bywattmeter is

Similarly,
(12.68)
since Comparing Eq. (12.68) with Eq. (12.51) shows
that the difference of the wattmeter readings is proportional to the totalreactive power, or
(12.69)
From Eqs. (12.67) and (12.69), the total apparent power can beobtained as
(12.70)
Dividing Eq. (12.69) by Eq. (12.67) gives the tangent of the power fac-tor angle as
(12.71)
from which we can obtain the power factor as Thus, thetwo-wattmeter method not only provides the total real and reactive pow-ers, it can also be used to compute the power factor. From Eqs. (12.67),(12.69), and (12.71), we conclude that:
1. If the load is resistive.2. If the load is inductive.3. If the load is capacitive.
Although these results are derived from a balanced wye-connectedload, they are equally valid for a balanced delta-connected load. How-ever, the two-wattmeter method cannot be used for power measurementin a three-phase four-wire system unless the current through the neu-tral line is zero. We use the three-wattmeter method to measure the realpower in a three-phase four-wire system.P

12.10.2 Residential Wiring
In the United States, most household lighting and appliances operate on
120-V , 60-Hz, single-phase alternating current. (The electricity may alsobe supplied at 110, 115, or 117 V , depending on the location.) The localpower company supplies the house with a three-wire ac system. Typi-cally, as in Fig. 12.37, the line voltage of, say, 12,000 V is stepped downto 120/240 V with a transformer (more details on transformers in the nextchapter). The three wires coming from the transformer are typically col-ored red (hot), black (hot), and white (neutral). As shown in Fig. 12.38,the two 120-V voltages are opposite in phase and hence add up to zero.That is,

Since most appliances are designed to operate with 120 V , the lighting
and appliances are connected to the 120-V lines, as illustrated inFig. 12.39 for a room. Notice in Fig. 12.37 that all appliances are con-nected in parallel. Heavy appliances that consume large currents, suchas air conditioners, dishwashers, ovens, and laundry machines, are con-nected to the 240-V power line.
Because of the dangers of electricity, house wiring is carefully reg-
ulated by a code drawn by local ordinances and by the National Elec-trical Code (NEC). To avoid trouble, insulation, grounding, fuses, andcircuit breakers are used. Modern wiring codes require a third wire fora separate ground. The ground wire does not carry power like the neu-tral wire but enables appliances to have a separate ground connection.Figure 12.40 shows the connection of the receptacle to a 120-V rmsline and to the ground. As shown in the ﬁgure, the neutral line is con-nected to the ground (the earth) at many critical locations. Althoughthe ground line seems redundant, grounding is important for manyreasons. First, it is required by NEC. Second, grounding provides a12.10 Applications 541

convenient path to ground for lightning that strikes the power line.
Third, grounds minimize the risk of electric shock. What causes shockis the passage of current from one part of the body to another. Thehuman body is like a big resistor R. If V is the potential difference
between the body and the ground, the current through the body is deter-mined by Ohm’s law as
(12.73)
The value of R varies from person to person and depends on whether
the body is wet or dry. How great or how deadly the shock is dependson the amount of current, the pathway of the current through thebody, and the length of time the body is exposed to the current. Cur-rents less than 1 mA may not be harmful to the body, but currentsgreater than 10 mA can cause severe shock. A modern safety deviceis the ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), used in outdoor circuits
and in bathrooms, where the risk of electric shock is greatest. It isessentially a circuit breaker that opens when the sum of the currents
and through the red, white, and the black lines is not equal
to zero, or 
The best way to avoid electric shock is to follow safety guide-
lines concerning electrical systems and appliances. Here are some ofthem:
•Never assume that an electrical circuit is dead. Always check tobe sure.
•Use safety devices when necessary, and wear suitable clothing(insulated shoes, gloves, etc.).
•Never use two hands when testing high-voltage circuits, since thecurrent through one hand to the other hand has a direct paththrough your chest and heart.
•Do not touch an electrical appliance when you are wet. Remem-ber that water conducts electricity.
•Be extremely careful when working with electronic appliancessuch as radio and TV because these appliances have large capac-itors in them. The capacitors take time to discharge after the poweris disconnected.
•Always have another person present when working on a wiringsystem, just in case of an accident.i

Career in Electromagnetics
Electromagnetics is the branch of electrical engineering (or physics)that deals with the analysis and application of electric and magneticﬁelds. In electromagnetics, electric circuit analysis is applied at lowfrequencies.
The principles of electromagnetics (EM) are applied in various allied
disciplines, such as electric machines, electromechanical energy conver-sion, radar meteorology, remote sensing, satellite communications, bio-electromagnetics, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, plasmas,and ﬁber optics. EM devices include electric motors and generators, trans-formers, electromagnets, magnetic levitation, antennas, radars, microwaveovens, microwave dishes, superconductors, and electrocardiograms. Thedesign of these devices requires a thorough knowledge of the laws andprinciples of EM.
EM is regarded as one of the more difﬁcult disciplines in electri-
cal engineering. One reason is that EM phenomena are rather abstract.But if one enjoys working with mathematics and can visualize theinvisible, one should consider being a specialist in EM, since few elec-trical engineers specialize in this area. Electrical engineers who special-ize in EM are needed in microwave industries, radio/TV broadcastingstations, electromagnetic research laboratories, and several communi-cations industries.

556 Chapter 13 Magnetically Coupled Circuits
Introduction
The circuits we have considered so far may be regarded as conduc-
tively coupled, because one loop affects the neighboring loop through
current conduction. When two loops with or without contacts betweenthem affect each other through the magnetic ﬁeld generated by one ofthem, they are said to be magnetically coupled.
The transformer is an electrical device designed on the basis of the
concept of magnetic coupling. It uses magnetically coupled coils totransfer energy from one circuit to another. Transformers are key cir-cuit elements. They are used in power systems for stepping up or step-ping down ac voltages or currents. They are used in electronic circuitssuch as radio and television receivers for such purposes as impedancematching, isolating one part of a circuit from another, and again forstepping up or down ac voltages and currents.
We will begin with the concept of mutual inductance and intro-
duce the dot convention used for determining the voltage polarities ofinductively coupled components. Based on the notion of mutual induc-tance, we then introduce the circuit element known as the transformer.
We will consider the linear transformer, the ideal transformer, the ideal
autotransformer, and the three-phase transformer. Finally, among their13.1James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), a graduate in mathematics from
Cambridge University, in 1865 wrote a most remarkable paper in which
he mathematically uniﬁed the laws of Faraday and Ampere. This rela-tionship between the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld served as the basisfor what was later called electromagnetic ﬁelds and waves, a majorﬁeld of study in electrical engineering. The Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers (IEEE) uses a graphical representation of thisprinciple in its logo, in which a straight arrow represents current anda curved arrow represents the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This relationshipis commonly known as the right-hand rule. Maxwell was a very active
theoretician and scientist. He is best known for the “Maxwell equa-tions.” The maxwell, a unit of magnetic ﬂux, was named after him.

important applications, we look at transformers as isolating and match-
ing devices and their use in power distribution.
Mutual Inductance
When two inductors (or coils) are in a close proximity to each other,the magnetic ﬂux caused by current in one coil links with the othercoil, thereby inducing voltage in the latter. This phenomenon is knownas mutual inductance .
Let us ﬁrst consider a single inductor, a coil with Nturns. When
current iﬂows through the coil, a magnetic ﬂux is produced around
it (Fig. 13.1). According to Faraday’s law, the voltage induced in thecoil is proportional to the number of turns Nand the time rate of change
of the magnetic ﬂux ; that is,
(13.1)
But the ﬂux is produced by current iso that any change in is
caused by a change in the current. Hence, Eq. (13.1) can be written as
(13.2)
or
(13.3)
which is the voltage-current relationship for the inductor. From Eqs. (13.2)and (13.3), the inductance Lof the inductor is thus given by
(13.4)
This inductance is commonly called self-inductance, because it relates
the voltage induced in a coil by a time-varying current in the same coil.
Now consider two coils with self-inductances and that are
in close proximity with each other (Fig. 13.2). Coil 1 has turns,while coil 2 has turns. For the sake of simplicity, assume that thesecond inductor carries no current. The magnetic ﬂux emanatingfrom coil 1 has two components: one component links only coil 1,and another component links both coils. Hence,
(13.5)
Although the two coils are physically separated, they are said to bemagnetically coupled. Since the entire ﬂux links coil 1, the voltage
induced in coil 1 is
(13.6)
Only ﬂux links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is

Again, as the ﬂuxes are caused by the current ﬂowing in coil 1,
Eq. (13.6) can be written as
(13.8)
where is the self-inductance of coil 1. Similarly,
Eq. (13.7) can be written as
(13.9)
where
(13.10)
is known as the mutual inductance of coil 2 with respect to coil 1.
Subscript 21 indicates that the inductance relates the voltageinduced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1. Thus, the open-circuit mutual
voltage (or induced voltage) across coil 2 is
(13.11)
Suppose we now let current ﬂow in coil 2, while coil 1 carries
no current (Fig. 13.3). The magnetic ﬂux emanating from coil 2comprises ﬂux that links only coil 2 and ﬂux that links bothcoils. Hence,
(13.12)
The entire ﬂux links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is
(13.13)
where is the self-inductance of coil 2. Since only ﬂux
links coil 1, the voltage induced in coil 1 is
(13.14)
where
(13.15)
which is the mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to coil 2. Thus,
the open-circuit mutual voltage across coil 1 is

and we refer to M as the mutual inductance between the two coils. Like
self-inductance L, mutual inductance M is measured in henrys (H).
Keep in mind that mutual coupling only exists when the inductors or
coils are in close proximity, and the circuits are driven by time-varyingsources. We recall that inductors act like short circuits to dc.
From the two cases in Figs. 13.2 and 13.3, we conclude that
mutual inductance results if a voltage is induced by a time-varyingcurrent in another circuit. It is the property of an inductor to producea voltage in reaction to a time-varying current in another inductor nearit. Thus,13.2 Mutual Inductance 559
Mutual inductance is the ability of one inductor to induce a voltage
across a neighboring inductor, measured in henrys (H).
Although mutual inductance M is always a positive quantity, the
mutual voltage may be negative or positive, just like the self-
induced voltage However, unlike the self-induced whose polarity is determined by the reference direction of the currentand the reference polarity of the voltage (according to the passive signconvention), the polarity of mutual voltage is not easy to deter-mine, because four terminals are involved. The choice of the correctpolarity for is made by examining the orientation or particu-lar way in which both coils are physically wound and applying Lenz’slaw in conjunction with the right-hand rule. Since it is inconvenient toshow the construction details of coils on a circuit schematic, we applythe dot convention in circuit analysis. By this convention, a dot is
placed in the circuit at one end of each of the two magnetically cou-pled coils to indicate the direction of the magnetic ﬂux if current entersthat dotted terminal of the coil. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.4. Givena circuit, the dots are already placed beside the coils so that we neednot bother about how to place them. The dots are used along with thedot convention to determine the polarity of the mutual voltage. The dotconvention is stated as follows:M di/H20862dtM di/H20862dtL di/H20862dt, L di/H20862dt.M di/H20862dt
If a current enters the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polarity
of the mutual voltage in the second coil is positive at the dotted
terminal of the second coil.

Alternatively,560 Chapter 13 Magnetically Coupled Circuits
If a current leaves the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polar-
ity of the mutual voltage in the second coil is negative at the dotted
terminal of the second coil.
Thus, the reference polarity of the mutual voltage depends on the ref-
erence direction of the inducing current and the dots on the coupledcoils. Application of the dot convention is illustrated in the four pairsof mutually coupled coils in Fig. 13.5. For the coupled coils in Fig. 13.5(a), the sign of the mutual voltage is determined by the ref-erence polarity for and the direction of . Since enters the dottedterminal of coil 1 and is positive at the dotted terminal of coil 2, themutual voltage is . For the coils in Fig. 13.5(b), the current
enters the dotted terminal of coil 1 and is negative at the dotted
terminal of coil 2. Hence, the mutual voltage is . The samereasoning applies to the coils in Fig. 13.5(c) and 13.5(d).
Figure 13.6 shows the dot convention for coupled coils in series.
For the coils in Fig. 13.6(a), the total inductance is

Now that we know how to determine the polarity of the mutual
voltage, we are prepared to analyze circuits involving mutual induc-tance. As the ﬁrst example, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.7. ApplyingKVL to coil 1 gives

tromagnetics to the actual physical properties of the coils. In this text, weassume that the mutual inductance and the placement of the dots are the“givens’’ of the circuit problem, like the circuit components R,L, and C .0/H11005/H11002 j/H9275M

Solution:
The key to analyzing a magnetically coupled circuit is knowingthe polarity of the mutual voltage. We need to apply the dot rule. InFig. 13.11, suppose coil 1 is the one whose reactance is and coil2 is the one whose reactance is To ﬁgure out the polarity of themutual voltage in coil 1 due to current we observe that leaves thedotted terminal of coil 2. Since we are applying KVL in the clockwisedirection, it implies that the mutual voltage is negative, that is, 
Alternatively, it might be best to ﬁgure out the mutual voltage by
redrawing the relevant portion of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.12(a),where it becomes clear that the mutual voltage is . V

Thus, for mesh 1 in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives
or
(13.2.1)
Similarly, to ﬁgure out the mutual voltage in coil 2 due to current ,
consider the relevant portion of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.12(b).Applying the dot convention gives the mutual voltage as Also, current sees the two coupled coils in series in Fig. 13.11; sinceit leaves the dotted terminals in both coils, Eq. (13.18) applies.Therefore, for mesh 2 in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives
or
(13.2.2)
Putting Eqs. (13.2.1) and (13.2.2) in matrix form, we get
The determinants are
Thus, we obtain the mesh currents as

Energy in a Coupled Circuit
In Chapter 6, we saw that the energy stored in an inductor is given by
(13.23)
We now want to determine the energy stored in magnetically coupled
coils.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 13.14. We assume that currents and 
are zero initially, so that the energy stored in the coils is zero. If we let
increase from zero to while maintaining , the power in coil 1 is
(13.24)
and the energy stored in the circuit is
(13.25)
If we now maintain and increase from zero to the mutualvoltage induced in coil 1 is while the mutual voltage inducedin coil 2 is zero, since does not change. The power in the coils is now
(13.26)
and the energy stored in the circuit is
(13.27)
The total energy stored in the coils when both and have reachedconstant values is
(13.28)
If we reverse the order by which the currents reach their ﬁnal values,that is, if we ﬁrst increase from zero to and later increase fromzero to the total energy stored in the coils is
(13.29)
Since the total energy stored should be the same regardless of how wereach the ﬁnal conditions, comparing Eqs. (13.28) and (13.29) leads usto conclude that

nal, the mutual voltage is negative, so that the mutual energy isalso negative. In that case,
(13.31)
Also, since and are arbitrary values, they may be replaced by and
which gives the instantaneous energy stored in the circuit the general
expression
(13.32)
The positive sign is selected for the mutual term if both currents enteror leave the dotted terminals of the coils; the negative sign is selectedotherwise.
We will now establish an upper limit for the mutual inductance M.
The energy stored in the circuit cannot be negative because the circuitis passive. This means that the quantity must be greater than or equal to zero:
(13.33)
To complete the square, we both add and subtract the term 
on the right-hand side of Eq. (13.33) and obtain
(13.34)
The squared term is never negative; at its least it is zero. Therefore,the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (13.34) must be greaterthan zero; that is,
or
(13.35)
Thus, the mutual inductance cannot be greater than the geometric mean
of the self-inductances of the coils. The extent to which the mutualinductance Mapproaches the upper limit is speciﬁed by the coefﬁcient
of coupling k, given by
(13.36)
or
(13.37)

ﬁcient is the fraction of the total ﬂux emanating from one coil that linksthe other coil. For example, in Fig. 13.2,

Linear Transformers
Here we introduce the transformer as a new circuit element. A trans-
former is a magnetic device that takes advantage of the phenomenonof mutual inductance.13.4ale29559_ch13.qxd  07/10/2008  03:59 PM  Page 567

568 Chapter 13 Magnetically Coupled Circuits
A transformer is generally a four-terminal device comprising two (or
more) magnetically coupled coils.
As shown in Fig. 13.19, the coil that is directly connected to the volt-
age source is called the primary winding. The coil connected to the
load is called the secondary winding . The resistances and are
included to account for the losses (power dissipation) in the coils. Thetransformer is said to be linear if the coils are wound on a magneti-
cally linear material—a material for which the magnetic permeabilityis constant. Such materials include air, plastic, Bakelite, and wood. Infact, most materials are magnetically linear. Linear transformers aresometimes called air-core transformers , although not all of them are
necessarily air-core. They are used in radio and TV sets. Figure 13.20portrays different types of transformers.R

We would like to obtain the input impedance as seen from the
source, because governs the behavior of the primary circuit. Apply-
ing KVL to the two meshes in Fig. 13.19 gives
(13.40a)
(13.40b)
In Eq. (13.40b), we express in terms of and substitute it intoEq. (13.40a). We get the input impedance as
(13.41)
Notice that the input impedance comprises two terms. The ﬁrst term,( ), is the primary impedance. The second term is due to the
coupling between the primary and secondary windings. It is as thoughthis impedance is reﬂected to the primary. Thus, it is known as thereﬂected impedance and
(13.42)
It should be noted that the result in Eq. (13.41) or (13.42) is notaffected by the location of the dots on the transformer, because thesame result is produced when Mis replaced by 
The little bit of experience gained in Sections 13.2 and 13.3 in ana-
lyzing magnetically coupled circuits is enough to convince anyone thatanalyzing these circuits is not as easy as circuits in previous chapters.For this reason, it is sometimes convenient to replace a magneticallycoupled circuit by an equivalent circuit with no magnetic coupling. Wewant to replace the linear transformer in Fig. 13.21 by an equivalent Tor circuit, a circuit that would have no mutual inductance.
The voltage-current relationships for the primary and secondary
coils give the matrix equation
(13.43)
By matrix inversion, this can be written as
(13.44)
Our goal is to match Eqs. (13.43) and (13.44) with the correspondingequations for the T and networks.

Solution:
Notice that the circuit in Fig. 13.27 is the same as that in Fig. 13.10except that the reference direction for current has been reversed, justto make the reference directions for the currents for the magneticallycoupled coils conform with those in Fig. 13.21.
We need to replace the magnetically coupled coils with the T-
equivalent circuit. The relevant portion of the circuit in Fig. 13.27 isshown in Fig. 13.28(a). Comparing Fig. 13.28(a) with Fig. 13.21 showsthat there are two differences. First, due to the current referencedirections and voltage polarities, we need to replace Mby to make
Fig. 13.28(a) conform with Fig. 13.21. Second, the circuit in Fig. 13.21is in the time-domain, whereas the circuit in Fig. 13.28(a) is inthe frequency-domain. The difference is the factor that is, Lin
Fig. 13.21 has been replaced with and Mwith Since is
not speciﬁed, we can assume or any other value; it really
does not matter. With these two differences in mind,
Thus, the T-equivalent circuit for the coupled coils is as shown in
Fig. 13.28(b).
Inserting the T-equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.28(b) to replace the two
coils in Fig. 13.27 gives the equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.29, which can besolved using nodal or mesh analysis. Applying mesh analysis, we obtain

Substituting Eq. (13.6.3) into Eq. (13.6.1) gives
Since 100 is very large compared with 1, the imaginary part of

Ideal Transformers
An ideal transformer is one with perfect coupling ( ). It consists
of two (or more) coils with a large number of turns wound on a com-mon core of high permeability. Because of this high permeability ofthe core, the ﬂux links all the turns of both coils, thereby resulting ina perfect coupling.
To see how an ideal transformer is the limiting case of two coupled
inductors where the inductances approach inﬁnity and the coupling is per-fect, let us reexamine the circuit in Fig. 13.14. In the frequency domain,

From Eq. (13.49a), (we could have also use
this equation to develop the current ratios instead of using the conser-
vation of power which we will do shortly). Substituting this inEq. (13.49b) gives
But for perfect coupling Hence,
where and is called the turns ratio .A s such
thatnremains the same, the coupled coils become an ideal transformer.
Atransformer is said to be ideal if it has the following properties:
1. Coils have very large reactances 
2. Coupling coefﬁcient is equal to unity 3. Primary and secondary coils are lossless ( R

for ideal transformers.An ideal transformer is a unity-coupled, lossless transformer in which
the primary and secondary coils have inﬁnite self-inductances.
Iron-core transformers are close approximations to ideal transformers.
These are used in power systems and electronics.
Figure 13.30(a) shows a typical ideal transformer; the circuit sym-
bol is in Fig. 13.30(b). The vertical lines between the coils indicate aniron core as distinct from the air core used in linear transformers. Theprimary winding has turns; the secondary winding has turns.
When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the primary winding as
shown in Fig. 13.31, the same magnetic ﬂux goes through bothwindings. According to Faraday’s law, the voltage across the primarywinding is
(13.50a)
while that across the secondary winding is

For the reason of power conservation, the energy supplied to the pri-
mary must equal the energy absorbed by the secondary, since there areno losses in an ideal transformer. This implies that

In phasor form, Eq. (13.53) in conjunction with Eq. (13.52) becomes

A step-down transformer is one whose secondary voltage is less than
its primary voltage.
A step-up transformer is one whose secondary voltage is greater than
its primary voltage.
The ratings of transformers are usually speciﬁed as A trans-
former with rating 2400/120 V should have 2400 V on the primary and120 in the secondary (i.e., a step-down transformer). Keep in mind thatthe voltage ratings are in rms.
Power companies often generate at some convenient voltage and
use a step-up transformer to increase the voltage so that the power canbe transmitted at very high voltage and low current over transmissionlines, resulting in signiﬁcant cost savings. Near residential consumerpremises, step-down transformers are used to bring the voltage downto 120 V . Section 13.9.3 will elaborate on this.
It is important that we know how to get the proper polarity of the
voltages and the direction of the currents for the transformer in Fig. 13.31.If the polarity of or or the direction of or is changed, nin
Eqs. (13.51) to (13.55) may need to be replaced by The two sim-ple rules to follow are:
1. If and are both positive or both negative at the dotted ter-
minals, use in Eq. (13.52). Otherwise, use 
2. If and both enter into or both leave the dotted terminals, use
in Eq. (13.55). Otherwise, use

Notice that an ideal transformer reﬂects
an impedance as the square of theturns ratio.Using Eqs. (13.52) and (13.55), we can always express in terms
of and in terms of or vice versa:
(13.56)
(13.57)
The complex power in the primary winding is
(13.58)
showing that the complex power supplied to the primary is delivered
to the secondary without loss. The transformer absorbs no power. Ofcourse, we should expect this, since the ideal transformer is lossless.The input impedance as seen by the source in Fig. 13.31 is found fromEqs. (13.56) and (13.57) as
(13.59)
It is evident from Fig. 13.31 that so that
(13.60)
The input impedance is also called the reﬂected impedance, since it
appears as if the load impedance is reﬂected to the primary side. Thisability of the transformer to transform a given impedance into anotherimpedance provides us a means of impedance matching to ensure
maximum power transfer. The idea of impedance matching is very use-ful in practice and will be discussed more in Section 13.9.2.
In analyzing a circuit containing an ideal transformer, it is com-
mon practice to eliminate the transformer by reﬂecting impedancesand sources from one side of the transformer to the other. In the cir-cuit of Fig. 13.33, suppose we want to reﬂect the secondary side ofthe circuit to the primary side.

The general rule for eliminating the transformer and reﬂecting the sec-
ondary circuit to the primary side is: divide the secondary impedanceby 
n2, divide the secondary voltage by n, and multiply the secondary
current by n.
We can also reﬂect the primary side of the circuit in Fig. 13.33 to
the secondary side. Figure 13.36 shows the equivalent circuit.
The rule for eliminating the transformer and reflecting the primary
circuit to the secondary side is: multiply the primary impedance by
n2, multiply the primary voltage by n, and divide the primary current
by n.
According to Eq. (13.58), the power remains the same, whether calcu-
lated on the primary or the secondary side. But realize that this reﬂec-tion approach only applies if there are no external connections betweenthe primary and secondary windings. When we have external connec-tions between the primary and secondary windings, we simply use reg-ular mesh and nodal analysis. Examples of circuits where there areexternal connections between the primary and secondary windings arein Figs. 13.39 and 13.40. Also note that if the locations of the dots inFig. 13.33 are changed, we might have to replace nby in order to
obey the dot rule, illustrated in Fig. 13.32./H11002n+−Z1

Ideal Autotransformers
Unlike the conventional two-winding transformer we have considered
so far, an autotransformer has a single continuous winding with a con-
nection point called a tap between the primary and secondary sides.
The tap is often adjustable so as to provide the desired turns ratio forstepping up or stepping down the voltage. This way, a variable voltageis provided to the load connected to the autotransformer.13.613.6 Ideal Autotransformers 581
An autotransformer is a transformer in which both the primary and the
secondary are in a single winding.
Figure 13.41 shows a typical autotransformer. As shown in
Fig. 13.42, the autotransformer can operate in the step-down or step-
up mode. The autotransformer is a type of power transformer. Itsmajor advantage over the two-winding transformer is its ability totransfer larger apparent power. Example 13.10 will demonstrate this.Another advantage is that an autotransformer is smaller and lighterthan an equivalent two-winding transformer. However, since both theprimary and secondary windings are one winding, electrical isolation
(no direct electrical connection) is lost. (We will see how the propertyof electrical isolation in the conventional transformer is practicallyemployed in Section 13.9.1.) The lack of electrical isolation betweenthe primary and secondary windings is a major disadvantage of theautotransformer.
Some of the formulas we derived for ideal transformers apply to
ideal autotransformers as well. For the step-down autotransformer cir-cuit of Fig. 13.42(a), Eq. (13.52) gives
(13.63)
As an ideal autotransformer, there are no losses, so the complex powerremains the same in the primary and secondary windings:
(13.64)
Equation (13.64) can also be expressed as
or
(13.65)
Thus, the current relationship is

(13.67)
The complex power given by Eq. (13.64) also applies to the step-up
autotransformer so that Eq. (13.65) again applies. Hence, the currentrelationship is
(13.68)
Amajor difference between conventional transformers and auto-
transformers is that the primary and secondary sides of the autotrans-former are not only coupled magnetically but also coupled conductively.The autotransformer can be used in place of a conventional transformerwhen electrical isolation is not required.I

Solution:
Although the primary and secondary windings of the autotransformerare together as a continuous winding, they are separated in Fig. 13.43(b)for clarity. We note that the current and voltage of each winding of theautotransformer in Fig. 13.43(b) are the same as those for the two-winding transformer in Fig. 13.43(a). This is the basis of comparingtheir power ratings.

Three-Phase Transformers
To meet the demand for three-phase power transmission, transformer
connections compatible with three-phase operations are needed. We can
achieve the transformer connections in two ways: by connecting threesingle-phase transformers, thereby forming a so-called transformerbank, or by using a special three-phase transformer. For the same kV Arating, a three-phase transformer is always smaller and cheaper thanthree single-phase transformers. When single-phase transformers areused, one must ensure that they have the same turns ratio nto achieve
a balanced three-phase system. There are four standard ways of con-necting three single-phase transformers or a three-phase transformer forthree-phase operations: Y-Y , and 
For any of the four connections, the total apparent power real
power and reactive power are obtained as

where and are, respectively, equal to the line voltage and theline current for the primary side, or the line voltage and theline current for the secondary side. Notice From Eq. (13.69) thatfor each of the four connections, since power mustbe conserved in an ideal transformer.
For the Y-Y connection (Fig. 13.46), the line voltage at the pri-
mary side, the line voltage on the secondary side, the line current on the primary side, and the line current on the secondary side arerelated to the transformer per phase turns ratio n according to Eqs. (13.52)

the line voltages and line currents. This connection is unique in the¢ ¢I

sense that if one of the transformers is removed for repair or mainte-
nance, the other two form an open delta, which can provide three-
phase voltages at a reduced level of the original three-phase transformer.

Solution:
(a) A careful observation of Fig. 13.50 shows that the primary side is
Y-connected, while the secondary side is -connected. Thus, the three-
phase transformer is Y- similar to the one shown in Fig. 13.48.(b) Given a load with total apparent power kV A, the turns ratio

From Eq. (13.71),
(c) Because the load is balanced, each transformer equally shares the
total load and since there are no losses (assuming ideal transformers),the kV A rating of each transformer is Alter-natively, the transformer rating can be determined by the product of thephase current and phase voltage of the primary or secondary side.

PSpice Analysis of Magnetically
Coupled Circuits
PSpice analyzes magnetically coupled circuits just like inductor circuits
except that the dot convention must be followed. In PSpice Schematic,
the dot (not shown) is always next to pin 1, which is the left-hand ter-
minal of the inductor when the inductor with part name L is placed(horizontally) without rotation on a schematic. Thus, the dot or pin 1will be at the bottom after one counterclockwise rotation, sincerotation is always about pin 1. Once the magnetically coupled induc-tors are arranged with the dot convention in mind and their value90/H1103413.8ale29559_ch13.qxd  07/10/2008  03:59 PM  Page 586

attributes are set in henries, we use the coupling symbol K_LINEAR
to deﬁne the coupling. For each pair of coupled inductors, take the fol-lowing steps:
1. Select Draw/Get New Part and type K_LINEAR.
2. Hit <enter> or click OK and place the K_LINEAR symbol on the
schematic, as shown in Fig. 13.51. (Notice that K_LINEAR is nota component and therefore has no pins.)
3.DCLICKL on COUPLING and set the value of the coupling coef-
ﬁcient k.
4.DCLICKL on the boxed K (the coupling symbol) and enter the
reference designator names for the coupled inductors as valuesof Li, For example, if inductors L20 and L23
are coupled, we set and L1 and at leastone other Li must be assigned values; other Li’s may be leftblank.
In step 4, up to six coupled inductors with equal coupling can bespeciﬁed.
For the air-core transformer, the partname is XFRM_LINEAR.
It can be inserted in a circuit by selecting Draw/Get Part Name and
then typing in the part name or by selecting the part name from theanalog.slb library. As shown typically in Fig. 13.52(a), the mainattributes of the linear transformer are the coupling coefﬁcient k and
the inductance values L1 and L2 in henries. If the mutual inductanceMis specified, its value must be used along with L1 and L2 to
calculate k.Keep in mind that the value of k should lie between 0
and 1.
For the ideal transformer, the part name is XFRM NONLINEAR
and is located in the breakout.slb library. Select it by clickingDraw/Get Part Name and then typing in the part name. Its attributes
are the coupling coefﬁcient and the numbers of turns associated withL1 and L2, as illustrated typically in Fig. 13.52(b). The value of thecoefﬁcient of mutual coupling

Solution:
The coupling coefﬁcients of the three coupled inductors are determinedas follows:
The operating frequency f is obtained from Fig. 13.53 as 
The schematic of the circuit is portrayed in Fig. 13.54. Notice how
the dot convention is adhered to. For L2, the dot (not shown) is on pin
1 (the left-hand terminal) and is therefore placed without rotation. ForL1, in order for the dot to be on the right-hand side of the inductor,the inductor must be rotated through For L3, the inductor must berotated through so that the dot will be at the bottom. Note that the2-H inductor is not coupled. To handle the three coupled inductors,we use three K_LINEAR parts provided in the analog library and set thefollowing attributes (by double-clicking on the symbol K in the box):

Applications
Transformers are the largest, the heaviest, and often the costliest of cir-
cuit components. Nevertheless, they are indispensable passive devices
in electric circuits. They are among the most efﬁcient machines, 95 per-cent efﬁciency being common and 99 percent being achievable. Theyhave numerous applications. For example, transformers are used:
•To step up or step down voltage and current, making them useful
for power transmission and distribution.
•To isolate one portion of a circuit from another (i.e., to transfer
power without any electrical connection).
•As an impedance-matching device for maximum power transfer.
•In frequency-selective circuits whose operation depends on theresponse of inductances.13.9ale29559_ch13.qxd  07/10/2008  03:59 PM  Page 591

Because of these diverse uses, there are many special designs for
transformers (only some of which are discussed in this chapter): volt-
age transformers, current transformers, power transformers, distributiontransformers, impedance-matching transformers, audio transformers,single-phase transformers, three-phase transformers, rectiﬁer trans-formers, inverter transformers, and more. In this section, we considerthree important applications: transformer as an isolation device, trans-former as a matching device, and power distribution system. 
13.9.1 Transformer as an Isolation Device
Electrical isolation is said to exist between two devices when there isno physical connection between them. In a transformer, energy is trans-ferred by magnetic coupling, without electrical connection between theprimary circuit and secondary circuit. We now consider three simplepractical examples of how we take advantage of this property. 
First, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.59. A rectiﬁer is an electronic
circuit that converts an ac supply to a dc supply. A transformer is oftenused to couple the ac supply to the rectiﬁer. The transformer serves twopurposes. First, it steps up or steps down the voltage. Second, it provideselectrical isolation between the ac power supply and the rectiﬁer, therebyreducing the risk of shock hazard in handling the electronic device. 
As a second example, a transformer is often used to couple two
stages of an ampliﬁer, to prevent any dc voltage in one stage fromaffecting the dc bias of the next stage. Biasing is the application of adc voltage to a transistor ampliﬁer or any other electronic device inorder to produce a desired mode of operation. Each ampliﬁer stage isbiased separately to operate in a particular mode; the desired mode ofoperation will be compromised without a transformer providing dc iso-lation. As shown in Fig. 13.60, only the ac signal is coupled throughthe transformer from one stage to the next. We recall that magneticcoupling does not exist with a dc voltage source. Transformers are usedin radio and TV receivers to couple stages of high-frequency ampli-ﬁers. When the sole purpose of a transformer is to provide isolation,its turns ratio n is made unity. Thus, an isolation transformer has 
As a third example, consider measuring the voltage across 13.2-kV
lines. It is obviously not safe to connect a voltmeter directly tosuch high-voltage lines. A transformer can be used both to electricallyisolate the line power from the voltmeter and to step down the voltageto a safe level, as shown in Fig. 13.61. Once the voltmeter is used ton/H110051.592 Chapter 13 Magnetically Coupled Circuits

Solution:
We can apply the superposition principle to ﬁnd the load voltage. Let
where is due to the dc source and is due to
the ac source. We consider the dc and ac sources separately, as shownin Fig. 13.63. The load voltage due to the dc source is zero, because atime-varying voltage is necessary in the primary circuit to induce avoltage in the secondary circuit. Thus, For the ac source anda value of R
sso small it can be neglected,
Hence, ac or that is, only the ac voltageis passed to the load by the transformer. This example shows how thetransformer provides dc isolation.v

13.9.2 Transformer as a Matching Device
We recall that for maximum power transfer, the load resistance 
must be matched with the source resistance In most cases, the
two resistances are not matched; both are ﬁxed and cannot be altered.However, an iron-core transformer can be used to match the loadresistance to the source resistance. This is called impedance match-ing. For example, to connect a loudspeaker to an audio power ampli-ﬁer requires a transformer, because the speaker’s resistance is onlya few ohms while the internal resistance of the ampliﬁer is severalthousand ohms.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 13.64. We recall from Eq. (13.60)

to the loudspeaker to achieve maximum power transfer. The Thevenin(or output) impedance of the ampliﬁer is and the internal imped-ance of the speaker is Determine the required turns ratio.
Solution:
We replace the ampliﬁer circuit with the Thevenin equivalent and
reﬂect the impedance of the speaker to the primary side ofthe ideal transformer. Figure 13.66 shows the result. For maximumpower transfer,

speaker is much larger than without the ideal transformer. Without

13.9.3 Power Distribution
Apower system basically consists of three components: generation,
transmission, and distribution. The local electric company operates a
plant that generates several hundreds of megavolt-amperes (MV A), typ-ically at about 18 kV . As Fig. 13.67 illustrates, three-phase step-uptransformers are used to feed the generated power to the transmissionline. Why do we need the transformer? Suppose we need to transmit100,000 V A over a distance of 50 km. Since using a line volt-age of 1,000 V implies that the transmission line must carry 100 A andthis requires a transmission line of a large diameter. If, on the otherhand, we use a line voltage of 10,000 V , the current is only 10 A. Thesmaller current reduces the required conductor size, producing consid-erable savings as well as minimizing transmission line losses. Tominimize losses requires a step-up transformer. Without the trans-former, the majority of the power generated would be lost on the trans-mission line. The ability of the transformer to step up or step downvoltage and distribute power economically is one of the major reasonsfor generating ac rather than dc. Thus, for a given power, the larger thevoltage, the better. Today, 1 MV is the largest voltage in use; the levelmay increase as a result of research and experiments. I

Beyond the generation plant, the power is transmitted for hundreds
of miles through an electric network called the power grid. The three-
phase power in the power grid is conveyed by transmission lines hung
overhead from steel towers which come in a variety of sizes and shapes.The (aluminum-conductor, steel-reinforced) lines typically have over-all diameters up to about 40 mm and can carry current of up to 1,380 A.
At the substations, distribution transformers are used to step down
the voltage. The step-down process is usually carried out in stages.Power may be distributed throughout a locality by means of eitheroverhead or underground cables. The substations distribute the powerto residential, commercial, and industrial customers. At the receivingend, a residential customer is eventually supplied with 120/240 V , whileindustrial or commercial customers are fed with higher voltages suchOne may ask, How would increasing
the voltage not increase the current,thereby increasing

tion transformers often mounted on the poles of the electric utility com-pany. When direct current is needed, the alternating current is convertedto dc electronically. 596 Chapter 13 Magnetically Coupled Circuits

*13.96 Some modern power transmission systems now have
major, high voltage DC transmission segments.There are a lot of good reasons for doing this but wewill not go into them here. To go from the AC to DC,power electronics are used. We start with three-phaseAC and then rectify it (using a full-wave rectiﬁer). Itwas found that using a delta to wye and deltacombination connected secondary would give us amuch smaller ripple after the full-wave rectiﬁer.How is this accomplished? Remember that these arereal devices and are wound on common cores. Hint: using Figs. 13.47 and 13.49, and the fact that
each coil of the wye connected secondary and eachcoil of the delta connected secondary are woundaround the same core of each coil of the delta con-nected primary so the voltage of each of thecorresponding coils are in phase. When the outputleads of both secondaries are connected through full-wave rectiﬁers with the same load, you will see thatthe ripple is now greatly reduced. Please consult theinstructor for more help if necessary.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Control Systems
Control systems are another area of electrical engineering where circuitanalysis is used. A control system is designed to regulate the behaviorof one or more variables in some desired manner. Control systems playmajor roles in our everyday life. Household appliances such as heat-ing and air-conditioning systems, switch-controlled thermostats, wash-ers and dryers, cruise controllers in automobiles, elevators, trafﬁclights, manufacturing plants, navigation systems—all utilize controlsystems. In the aerospace ﬁeld, precision guidance of space probes, thewide range of operational modes of the space shuttle, and the abilityto maneuver space vehicles remotely from earth all require knowledgeof control systems. In the manufacturing sector, repetitive productionline operations are increasingly performed by robots, which are pro-grammable control systems designed to operate for many hours with-out fatigue.
Control engineering integrates circuit theory and communication
theory. It is not limited to any speciﬁc engineering discipline but mayinvolve environmental, chemical, aeronautical, mechanical, civil, andelectrical engineering. For example, a typical task for a control systemengineer might be to design a speed regulator for a disk drive head.
Athorough understanding of control systems techniques is essen-
tial to the electrical engineer and is of great value for designing con-trol systems to perform the desired task.ale29559_ch14.qxd  07/14/2008  04:19 PM  Page 613

Introduction
In our sinusoidal circuit analysis, we have learned how to ﬁnd volt-
ages and currents in a circuit with a constant frequency source. Ifwe let the amplitude of the sinusoidal source remain constant andvary the frequency, we obtain the circuit’s frequency response . The
frequency response may be regarded as a complete description ofthe sinusoidal steady-state behavior of a circuit as a function offrequency.14.1614 Chapter 14 Frequency Response
The frequency response of a circuit is the variation in its behavior with
change in signal frequency. 
The sinusoidal steady-state frequency responses of circuits are of
signiﬁcance in many applications, especially in communications and
control systems. A speciﬁc application is in electric ﬁlters that blockout or eliminate signals with unwanted frequencies and pass signals ofthe desired frequencies. Filters are used in radio, TV , and telephonesystems to separate one broadcast frequency from another.
We begin this chapter by considering the frequency response of
simple circuits using their transfer functions. We then consider Bodeplots, which are the industry-standard way of presenting frequencyresponse. We also consider series and parallel resonant circuits andencounter important concepts such as resonance, quality factor, cutofffrequency, and bandwidth. We discuss different kinds of ﬁlters and net-work scaling. In the last section, we consider one practical applicationof resonant circuits and two applications of ﬁlters.
Transfer Function
The transfer function (also called the network function) is auseful analytical tool for ﬁnding the frequency response of a circuit.In fact, the frequency response of a circuit is the plot of the circuit’stransfer function versus with varying from to
Atransfer function is the frequency-dependent ratio of a forced
function to a forcing function (or of an output to an input). The ideaof a transfer function was implicit when we used the concepts ofimpedance and admittance to relate voltage and current. In general,a linear network can be represented by the block diagram shown inFig. 14.1./H9275/H11005/H11009 ./H9275/H110050 /H9275 /H9275, H(/H9275)H(/H9275)14.2
The transfer function H()  of a circuit is the frequency-dependent
ratio of a phasor output Y()  (an element voltage or current) to a phasor
input X()  (source voltage or current)./H9275/H9275/H9275
Thus,

may also be considered as thevariation of the gain and phasewith frequency.

In this context, X() and Y () denote
the input and output phasors of a net-
work; they should not be confusedwith the same symbolism used for re-actance and admittance. The multipleusage of symbols is conventionallypermissible due to lack of enough let-ters in the English language to expressall circuit variables distinctly./H9275 /H9275ale29559_ch14.qxd  07/10/2008  03:49 PM  Page 614

assuming zero initial conditions. Since the input and output can be either
voltage or current at any place in the circuit, there are four possible trans-fer functions:
(14.2a)
(14.2b)
(14.2c)
(14.2d)
where subscripts i and odenote input and output values. Being a complex
quantity, has a magnitude and a phase ; that is, 
To obtain the transfer function using Eq. (14.2), we ﬁrst obtain the
frequency-domain equivalent of the circuit by replacing resistors,inductors, and capacitors with their impedances R, and Wethen use any circuit technique(s) to obtain the appropriate quantity inEq. (14.2). We can obtain the frequency response of the circuit by plot-ting the magnitude and phase of the transfer function as the frequencyvaries. A computer is a real time-saver for plotting the transfer function.
The transfer function can be expressed in terms of its numer-
ator polynomial and denominator polynomial as
(14.3)
where and are not necessarily the same expressions for theinput and output functions, respectively. The representation of inEq. (14.3) assumes that common numerator and denominator factors in

A zero, as a root of the numerator polynomial, is a value that results in
a zero value of the function. A pole, as a root of the denominator poly-
nomial, is a value for which the function is inﬁnite.

instead of H (), since and jare an

value of sj that makes H (s) zero,
and a pole as the value of sj that

The Decibel Scale
It is not always easy to get a quick plot of the magnitude and phase of
the transfer function as we did above. A more systematic way of obtain-ing the frequency response is to use Bode plots. Before we begin toconstruct Bode plots, we should take care of two important issues: theuse of logarithms and decibels in expressing gain.
Since Bode plots are based on logarithms, it is important that we
keep the following properties of logarithms in mind:
1.2.3.4.
In communications systems, gain is measured in bels. Historically,
the bel is used to measure the ratio of two levels of power or powergain G; that is,

The decibel (dB) provides us with a unit of less magnitude. It is 1 /H2086210th of
a bel and is given by

Equations (14.6) and (14.7) show another reason why logarithms are
greatly used: The logarithm of the reciprocal of a quantity is simplynegative the logarithm of that quantity.
Alternatively, the gain G can be expressed in terms of voltage
or current ratio. To do so, consider the network shown in Fig. 14.8. If

P1618 Chapter 14 Frequency Response
Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922) inventor of the telephone,
was a Scottish-American scientist.
Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, a son of Alexander Melville
Bell, a well-known speech teacher. Alexander the younger also became
a speech teacher after graduating from the University of Edinburgh andthe University of London. In 1866 he became interested in transmit-ting speech electrically. After his older brother died of tuberculosis, hisfather decided to move to Canada. Alexander was asked to come toBoston to work at the School for the Deaf. There he met Thomas A.Watson, who became his assistant in his electromagnetic transmitter
experiment. On March 10, 1876, Alexander sent the famous ﬁrst tele-phone message: “Watson, come here I want you.” The bel, the loga-rithmic unit introduced in Chapter 14, is named in his honor.

Instead, if and , for we obtain
(14.11)
Three things are important to note from Eqs. (14.5), (14.10), and (14.11):
1. That is used for power, while is used for voltage
or current, because of the square relationship between them
() .
2. That the dB value is a logarithmic measurement of the ratio of one
variable to another of the same type. Therefore, it applies inexpressing the transfer function H in Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b),
which are dimensionless quantities, but not in expressing H in
Eqs. (14.2c) and (14.2d).
3. It is important to note that we only use voltage and current mag-
nitudes in Eqs. (14.10) and (14.11). Negative signs and angles willbe handled independently as we will see in Section 14.4.
With this in mind, we now apply the concepts of logarithms and deci-
bels to construct Bode plots.
Bode Plots
Obtaining the frequency response from the transfer function as wedid in Section 14.2 is an uphill task. The frequency range required infrequency response is often so wide that it is inconvenient to use alinear scale for the frequency axis. Also, there is a more systematicway of locating the important features of the magnitude and phaseplots of the transfer function. For these reasons, it has become stan-dard practice to plot the transfer function on a pair of semilogarith-mic plots: the magnitude in decibels is plotted against the logarithmof the frequency; on a separate plot, the phase in degrees is plottedagainst the logarithm of the frequency. Such semilogarithmic plots ofthe transfer function—known as Bode plots—have become the indus-try standard.14.4P/H11005V 2/H20862R/H11005I 2R20 log 10 10 log 10GdB/H1100520 log 10 I2

1R114.4 Bode Plots 619
Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude (in decibels) and phase
(in degrees) of a transfer function versus frequency.
Bode plots contain the same information as the nonlogarithmic plots
discussed in the previous section, but they are much easier to construct,as we shall see shortly.
The transfer function can be written as
(14.12)
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,
(14.13)
Thus, the real part of is a function of the magnitude while theimaginary part is the phase. In a Bode magnitude plot, the gain

values of H with the corresponding values in decibels. In a Bode phase
plot, is plotted in degrees versus frequency. Both magnitude andphase plots are made on semilog graph paper.
Atransfer function in the form of Eq. (14.3) may be written in terms
of factors that have real and imaginary parts. One such representationmight be
(14.15)
which is obtained by dividing out the poles and zeros in Therepresentation of as in Eq. (14.15) is called the standard form .
may include up to seven types of different factors that can appear
in various combinations in a transfer function. These are:
1. A gain K
2. A pole or zero at the origin3. A simple pole or zero 
4. A quadratic pole or zero 
In constructing a Bode plot, we plot each factor separately and thenadd them graphically. The factors can be considered one at a time andthen combined additively because of the logarithms involved. It is thismathematical convenience of the logarithm that makes Bode plots apowerful engineering tool.
We will now make straight-line plots of the factors listed above.
We shall ﬁnd that these straight-line plots known as Bode plots approx-
imate the actual plots to a reasonable degree of accuracy.
Constant term: For the gain K, the magnitude is and the
phase is both are constant with frequency. Thus, the magnitude and
phase plots of the gain are shown in Fig. 14.9. If Kis negative, the
magnitude remains but the phase is .
Pole/zero at the origin: For the zero at the origin, the magni-
tude is and the phase is These are plotted in Fig. 14.10,where we notice that the slope of the magnitude plot is 20 dB/decade,while the phase is constant with frequency.
The Bode plots for the pole are similar except that the slope
of the magnitude plot is while the phase is In
general, for where N is an integer, the magnitude plot will have
a slope of 20N dB/decade, while the phase is 90 Ndegrees.(j/H9275)

Thus, the amplitude plot consists of two straight asymptotic lines: one

The phase can be expressed as
(14.21)
The phase plot is a straight line with a slope of per decade starting
at and ending at as shown in Fig. 14.12(b). We see againthat the difference between the actual plot and the straight-line plot is dueto the damping factor. Notice that the straight-line approximations for bothmagnitude and phase plots for the quadratic pole are the same as thosefor a double pole, i.e. We should expect this because
the double pole equals the quadratic pole 
when Thus, the quadratic pole can be
treated as a double pole as far as straight-line approximation is concerned.
For the quadratic zero , the plots in
Fig. 14.12 are inverted because the magnitude plot has a slope of40 dB/decade while the phase plot has a slope of per decade.
Table 14.3 presents a summary of Bode plots for the seven factors.
Of course, not every transfer function has all seven factors. To sketchthe Bode plots for a function in the form of Eq. (14.15), for exam-ple, we ﬁrst record the corner frequencies on the semilog graph paper,sketch the factors one at a time as discussed above, and then combineH(/H9275)90/H11034[1/H11001j2z

By starting withthe low-frequency asymptote of theBode plot, moving along the frequencyaxis, and increasing or decreasing theslope at each corner frequency, one cansketch the Bode plot immediately fromthe transfer function without the effortof making individual plots and addingthem.

If we just use the approximate value we used above, we end upwith an inﬁnite value, which is to be expected from (seeFig. 14.12a). If we used the actual value of H(j10) we will still

origin which should have intersected the frequency axis at . This isindicated by the straight line with slope The fact that thisstraight line is shifted by 40 dB indicates that there is a 40-dB gain; that is,
orIn addition to the zero at the origin, we notice that there are three
factors with corner frequencies at and 20 rad/s. Thus, we have:
1. A pole at with slope to cause a down-

Series Resonance
The most prominent feature of the frequency response of a circuit may
be the sharp peak (or resonant peak ) exhibited in its amplitude char-
acteristic. The concept of resonance applies in several areas of scienceand engineering. Resonance occurs in any system that has a complexconjugate pair of poles; it is the cause of oscillations of stored energyfrom one form to another. It is the phenomenon that allows frequency14.5Obtain the transfer function corresponding to the Bode plot in

discrimination in communications networks. Resonance occurs in any
circuit that has at least one inductor and one capacitor.630 Chapter 14 Frequency Response
Resonance is a condition in an RLCcircuit in which the capacitive and
inductive reactances are equal in magnitude, thereby resulting in a
purely resistive impedance.
Resonant circuits (series or parallel) are useful for constructing ﬁlters,
as their transfer functions can be highly frequency selective. They areused in many applications such as selecting the desired stations in radioand TV receivers.
Consider the series RLC circuit shown in Fig. 14.21 in the fre-
quency domain. The input impedance is
(14.22)
or
(14.23)
Resonance results when the imaginary part of the transfer function iszero, or
(14.24)
The value of that satisﬁes this condition is called the resonant fre-
quency . Thus, the resonance condition is
(14.25)
or
(14.26)
Since ,
(14.27)
Note that at resonance:
1. The impedance is purely resistive, thus, In other words,
the LCseries combination acts like a short circuit, and the entire
voltage is across R.
2. The voltage and the current are in phase, so that the power
factor is unity.
3. The magnitude of the transfer function is minimum.
4.The inductor voltage and capacitor voltage can be much morethan the source voltage.

in this graph when the frequency axis is a logarithm. The averagepower dissipated by the RLC circuit is

The highest power dissipated occurs at resonance, when sothat

At certain frequencies the dissipated power is half the
maximum value; that is,

Hence, and are called the half-power frequencies.
The half-power frequencies are obtained by setting Z equal to

Solving for , we obtain

We can relate the half-power frequencies with the resonant frequency.
From Eqs. (14.26) and (14.33),

showing that the resonant frequency is the geometric mean of the half-power frequencies. Notice that and are in general not symmet-rical around the resonant frequency , because the frequency responseis not generally symmetrical. However, as will be explained shortly,symmetry of the half-power frequencies around the resonant frequencyis often a reasonable approximation.
Although the height of the curve in Fig. 14.22 is determined by R,
the width of the curve depends on other factors. The width of theresponse curve depends on the bandwidth B, which is deﬁned as the
difference between the two half-power frequencies,
(14.35)
This deﬁnition of bandwidth is just one of several that are commonlyused. Strictly speaking, Bin Eq. (14.35) is a half-power bandwidth,
because it is the width of the frequency band between the half-powerfrequencies.

quality factor relates the maximum or peak energy stored to the energydissipated in the circuit per cycle of oscillation:

The quality factor of a resonant circuit is the ratio of its resonant
frequency to its bandwidth.
Keep in mind that Eqs. (14.33), (14.38), and (14.39) only apply to a
series RLC circuit.
As illustrated in Fig. 14.23, the higher the value of Q, the more
selective the circuit is but the smaller the bandwidth. The selectivity of
an RLC circuit is the ability of the circuit to respond to a certain fre-
quency and discriminate against all other frequencies. If the band offrequencies to be selected or rejected is narrow, the quality factor ofthe resonant circuit must be high. If the band of frequencies is wide,the quality factor must be low.
Aresonant circuit is designed to operate at or near its resonant fre-
quency. It is said to be a high-Q circuit when its quality factor is equal
to or greater than 10. For high- Qcircuits the half-power
frequencies are, for all practical purposes, symmetrical around the res-onant frequency and can be approximated as
(14.40)
High- Qcircuits are used often in communications networks./H9275

Parallel Resonance
The parallel RLC circuit in Fig. 14.25 is the dual of the series RLC cir-
cuit. So we will avoid needless repetition. The admittance is
(14.41)
or
(14.42)
Resonance occurs when the imaginary part of is zero,
(14.43)
or
(14.44)
which is the same as Eq. (14.26) for the series resonant circuit. The
voltage is sketched in Fig. 14.26 as a function of frequency.Notice that at resonance, the parallel LC combination acts like an
open circuit, so that the entire current ﬂows through R.Also, the
inductor and capacitor current can be much more than the sourcecurrent at resonance.
We exploit the duality between Figs. 14.21 and 14.25 by compar-
ing Eq. (14.42) with Eq. (14.23). By replacing R,L, and C in the|V|/H9275

For Practice Prob. 14.9 Passive Filters
The concept of ﬁlters has been an integral part of the evolution of elec-
trical engineering from the beginning. Several technological achieve-ments would not have been possible without electrical ﬁlters. Becauseof this prominent role of ﬁlters, much effort has been expended on thetheory, design, and construction of ﬁlters and many articles and bookshave been written on them. Our discussion in this chapter should beconsidered introductory.14.7
A ﬁlter is a circuit that is designed to pass signals with desired
frequencies and reject or attenuate others.
As a frequency-selective device, a ﬁlter can be used to limit the fre-
quency spectrum of a signal to some speciﬁed band of frequencies.Filters are the circuits used in radio and TV receivers to allow us toselect one desired signal out of a multitude of broadcast signals in theenvironment.
Aﬁlter is a passive ﬁlter if it consists of only passive elements R,
L, and C. It is said to be an active ﬁlter if it consists of active elements
(such as transistors and op amps) in addition to passive elements R,L,
andC. We consider passive ﬁlters in this section and active ﬁlters in
the next section. LCﬁlters have been used in practical applications for
more than eight decades. LC ﬁlter technology feeds related areas such
as equalizers, impedance-matching networks, transformers, shapingnetworks, power dividers, attenuators, and directional couplers, and iscontinuously providing practicing engineers with oppurtunities to inno-vate and experiment. Besides the LC ﬁlters we study in these sections,
there are other kinds of ﬁlters—such as digital ﬁlters, electromechanicalﬁlters, and microwave ﬁlters—which are beyond the level of this text.ale29559_ch14.qxd  07/10/2008  03:50 PM  Page 637

As shown in Fig. 14.30, there are four types of ﬁlters whether pas-
sive or active:
1. A lowpass ﬁlter passes low frequencies and stops high frequencies,
as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(a).
2. A highpass ﬁlter passes high frequencies and rejects low frequencies,
as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(b).
3. A bandpass ﬁlter passes frequencies within a frequency band and
blocks or attenuates frequencies outside the band, as shown ide-
ally in Fig. 14.30(c).
4. A bandstop ﬁlter passes frequencies outside a frequency band and
blocks or attenuates frequencies within the band, as shown ideallyin Fig. 14.30(d).
Table 14.5 presents a summary of the characteristics of these ﬁlters. Be
aware that the characteristics in Table 14.5 are only valid for ﬁrst- orsecond-order ﬁlters—but one should not have the impression that onlythese kinds of ﬁlter exist. We now consider typical circuits for realiz-ing the ﬁlters shown in Table 14.5.638 Chapter 14 Frequency Response

The RLC series resonant circuit provides a bandpass ﬁlter when the
output is taken off the resistor as shown in Fig. 14.35. The transfer
function is

A bandpass ﬁlter is designed to pass all frequencies within a band of
frequencies, /H927516/H92756/H92752.
Since the bandpass ﬁlter in Fig. 14.35 is a series resonant circuit, the
half-power frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality factor are deter-mined as in Section 14.5. A bandpass ﬁlter can also be formed bycascading the lowpass ﬁlter (where ) in Fig. 14.31 with the /H9275

would not be the same as just adding the output of the lowpass ﬁlter
to the input of the highpass ﬁlter, because one circuit loads the otherand alters the desired transfer function.
14.7.4 Bandstop Filter
Aﬁlter that prevents a band of frequencies between two designated
values and ) from passing is variably known as a bandstop, band-
reject, or notch ﬁlter. A bandstop ﬁlter is formed when the output RLC
series resonant circuit is taken off the LC series combination as shown
in Fig. 14.37. The transfer function is

Notice that Figure 14.38 shows the plot of

corresponding bandwidth is known as the bandwidth

A bandstop ﬁlter is designed to stop or eliminate all frequencies
within a band of frequencies, /H927516/H92756/H92752.
Notice that adding the transfer functions of the bandpass and the
bandstop gives unity at any frequency for the same values of R,L, and
C.Of course, this is not true in general but true for the circuits treated
here. This is due to the fact that the characteristic of one is the inverse
of the other.
In concluding this section, we should note that:
1.From Eqs. (14.50), (14.52), (14.54), and (14.56), the maximum gainof a passive ﬁlter is unity. To generate a gain greater than unity,one should use an active ﬁlter as the next section shows.
2.There are other ways to get the types of ﬁlters treated in this section.
3. The ﬁlters treated here are the simple types. Many other ﬁlters
have sharper and complex frequency responses.vi(t)R

Active Filters
There are three major limitations to the passive ﬁlters considered in the
previous section. First, they cannot generate gain greater than 1; pas-sive elements cannot add energy to the network. Second, they mayrequire bulky and expensive inductors. Third, they perform poorly atfrequencies below the audio frequency range Nevertheless, passive ﬁlters are useful at high frequencies.
Active ﬁlters consist of combinations of resistors, capacitors, and
op amps. They offer some advantages over passive RLC ﬁlters. First,
they are often smaller and less expensive, because they do not requireinductors. This makes feasible the integrated circuit realizations of ﬁl-ters. Second, they can provide ampliﬁer gain in addition to providingthe same frequency response as RLC ﬁlters. Third, active ﬁlters can be
combined with buffer ampliﬁers (voltage followers) to isolate eachstage of the ﬁlter from source and load impedance effects. This isola-tion allows designing the stages independently and then cascading themto realize the desired transfer function. (Bode plots, being logarithmic,may be added when transfer functions are cascaded.) However, activeﬁlters are less reliable and less stable. The practical limit of most active(300 Hz 6f63,000 Hz).

This way of creating a bandpass ﬁlter,
not necessarily the best, is perhaps theeasiest to understand.ﬁlters is about 100 kHz—most active ﬁlters operate well below that
frequency.
Filters are often classiﬁed according to their order (or number of
poles) or their speciﬁc design type.
14.8.1 First-Order Lowpass Filter
One type of ﬁrst-order ﬁlter is shown in Fig. 14.41. The componentsselected for and determine whether the ﬁlter is lowpass or high-pass, but one of the components must be reactive.
Figure 14.42 shows a typical active lowpass ﬁlter. For this ﬁlter,
the transfer function is

where and
(14.59)
Therefore,
(14.60)
We notice that Eq. (14.60) is similar to Eq. (14.50), except that there
is a low frequency gain or dc gain of Also, the cor-ner frequency is
(14.61)
which does not depend on This means that several inputs with dif-ferent could be summed if required, and the corner frequency wouldremain the same for each input.

of frequencies. By cascading a unity-gain lowpass ﬁlter, a unity-gain/H9275

Abandreject ﬁlter may be constructed by parallel combination of a

The formulas for calculating the values of the center frequency,
bandwidth, and quality factor are the same as in Eqs. (14.66) to (14.70).
To determine the passband gain K of the ﬁlter, we can write
Eq. (14.74) in terms of the upper and lower corner frequencies as
(14.75)
Comparing this with the standard form in Eq. (14.15) indicates that inthe two passbands and ) the gain is
(14.76)
We can also ﬁnd the gain at the center frequency by ﬁnding the mag-
nitude of the transfer function at writing
(14.77)
Again, the ﬁlters treated in this section are only typical. There are
many other active ﬁlters that are more complex. /H11005R

values by scaling. We have taken advantage of this idea by not using
realistic element values in most of our examples and problems; mas-
tering circuit analysis is made easy by using convenient component val-ues. We have thus eased calculations, knowing that we could usescaling to then make the values realistic.
There are two ways of scaling a circuit: magnitude or impedance
scaling, and frequency scaling. Both are useful in scaling responses
and circuit elements to values within the practical ranges. While mag-nitude scaling leaves the frequency response of a circuit unaltered,frequency scaling shifts the frequency response up or down the fre-quency spectrum.
14.9.1 Magnitude Scaling
Magnitude scaling is the process of increasing all impedances in a net-
work by a factor, the frequency response remaining unchanged.
Recall that impedances of individual elements R,L, and C are
given by
(14.78)
In magnitude scaling, we multiply the impedance of each circuit ele-
ment by a factor and let the frequency remain constant. This givesthe new impedances as
(14.79)
Comparing Eq. (14.79) with Eq. (14.78), we notice the following changesin the element values: and Thus, inmagnitude scaling, the new values of the elements and frequency are 
(14.80)
The primed variables are the new values and the unprimed variablesare the old values. Consider the series or parallel RLC circuit. We
now have
(14.81)
showing that the resonant frequency, as expected, has not changed.Similarly, the quality factor and the bandwidth are not affected by mag-nitude scaling. Also, magnitude scaling does not affect transfer func-tions in the forms of Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b), which are dimensionlessquantities./H9275¿

14.9.2 Frequency Scaling650 Chapter 14 Frequency Response
Frequency scaling is equivalent to rela-
beling the frequency axis of a fre-quency response plot. It is neededwhen translating frequencies such as aresonant frequency, a corner frequency,a bandwidth, etc., to a realistic level. Itcan be used to bring capacitance andinductance values into a range that isconvenient to work with.Frequency scaling is the process of shifting the frequency response of
a network up or down the frequency axis while leaving the impedance
the same.
We achieve frequency scaling by multiplying the frequency by a fac-
tor while keeping the impedance the same.
From Eq. (14.78), we see that the impedances of Land C are
frequency-dependent. If we apply frequency scaling to and 
in Eq. (14.78), we obtain
(14.82a)
(14.82b)
since the impedance of the inductor and capacitor must remain thesame after frequency scaling. We notice the following changes in theelement values: and The value of R is not
affected, since its impedance does not depend on frequency. Thus, infrequency scaling, the new values of the elements and frequency are
(14.83)
Again, if we consider the series or parallel RLC circuit, for the reso-
nant frequency
(14.84)
and for the bandwidth
(14.85)
but the quality factor remains the same 
14.9.3 Magnitude and Frequency Scaling
If a circuit is scaled in magnitude and frequency at the same time, then
(14.86)
These are more general formulas than those in Eqs. (14.80) and (14.83).We set in Eq. (14.86) when there is no magnitude scaling or
when there is no frequency scaling. K

Frequency Response Using PSpice
PSpice is a useful tool in the hands of the modern circuit designer for
obtaining the frequency response of circuits. The frequency response
is obtained using the AC Sweep as discussed in Section D.5 (Appen-dix D). This requires that we specify in the AC Sweep dialog box Total
Pts, Start Freq , End Freq, and the sweep type. Total Pts is the num-
ber of points in the frequency sweep, and Start Freq and End Freq are,
respectively, the starting and ﬁnal frequencies, in hertz. In order toknow what frequencies to select for Start Freq and End Freq, one must
have an idea of the frequency range of interest by making a roughsketch of the frequency response. In a complex circuit where this maynot be possible, one may use a trial-and-error approach.
There are three types of sweeps:
Linear: The frequency is varied linearly from Start Freq to End
Freq with Total Pts equally spaced points (or responses).
Octave: The frequency is swept logarithmically by octaves from
Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts per octave. An octave is
a factor of 2 (e.g., 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16).
Decade: The frequency is varied logarithmically by decades from
Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts per decade. A decade
is a factor of 10 (e.g., from 2 Hz to 20 Hz, 20 Hz to 200 Hz,
200 Hz to 2 kHz).
It is best to use a linear sweep when displaying a narrow frequencyrange of interest, as a linear sweep displays the frequency range wellin a narrow range. Conversely, it is best to use a logarithmic (octaveor decade) sweep for displaying a wide frequency range of interest—if a linear sweep is used for a wide range, all the data will be crowdedat the high- or low-frequency end and insufﬁcient data at the other end.
With the above speciﬁcations, PSpice performs a steady-state sinu-
soidal analysis of the circuit as the frequency of all the independentsources is varied (or swept) from Start Freq to End Freq .
The PSpice A/D program produces a graphical output. The output
data type may be speciﬁed in the Trace Command Box by adding one
of the following sufﬁxes to V or I:
M Amplitude of the sinusoid.
P Phase of the sinusoid.
dB Amplitude of the sinusoid in decibels, i.e., (amplitude). 20 log

Computation Using MATLAB
MATLAB is a software package that is widely used for engineering
computation and simulation. A review of MATLAB is provided in
Appendix E for the beginner. This section shows how to use the soft-
ware to numerically perform most of the operations presented in thischapter and Chapter 15. The key to describing a system in MATLAB is
to specify the numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the transferfunction of the system. Once this is done, we can use several MATLAB
commands to obtain the system’s Bode plots (frequency response) andthe system’s response to a given input.
The command bode produces the Bode plots (both magnitude and
phase) of a given transfer function H (s). The format of the command
is bode (num, den), where num is the numerator of H(s) and den is its
denominator. The frequency range and number of points are automat-ically selected. For example, consider the transfer function in Exam-ple 14.3. It is better to ﬁrst write the numerator and denominator inpolynomial forms.14.11Consider the network in Fig. 14.57. Use PSpice to obtain the Bode
plots for over a frequency from 1 kHz to 100 kHz using 20 points
per decade.VoPractice Problem 14.16ale29559_ch14.qxd  07/10/2008  03:50 PM  Page 655

Thus,
Using the following commands, the Bode plots are generated as shown
in Fig. 14.59. If necessary, the command logspace can be included to
generate a logarithmically spaced frequency and the command semilogx
can be used to produce a semilog scale.
>>num=[200 0]; %specifythenumeratorofH(s)
>>den=[1 12 20]; % specifythedenominatorofH(s)
>>bode(num, den); %determineanddrawBodeplots
The step response y(t) of a system is the output when the input x(t)i s
the unit step function. The command step plots the step response of a sys-
temgiven the numerator and denominator of the transfer function of that
system. The time range and number of points are automatically selected.For example, consider a second-order system with the transfer function
We obtain the step response of the system shown in Fig. 14.60 by using
the following commands.
>>n=12;
>>d=[1 3 12];>>step(n,d);
We can verify the plot in Fig. 14.60 by obtaining or

culates the time response of a system to any arbitrary input signal. The
format of the command is (num, den, x, t), where x (t) is the
input signal, tis the time vector, and y(t) is the output generated. For
example, assume a system is described by the transfer function

ics, power systems, and communications systems. For example, aNotch ﬁlter with a cutoff frequency at 60 Hz may be used to eliminatethe 60-Hz power line noise in various communications electronics. Fil-tering of signals in communications systems is necessary in order toselect the desired signal from a host of others in the same range (as inthe case of radio receivers discussed next) and also to minimize theeffects of noise and interference on the desired signal. In this section,we consider one practical application of resonant circuits and twoapplications of ﬁlters. The focus of each application is not to under-stand the details of how each device works but to see how the circuitsconsidered in this chapter are applied in the practical devices.
14.12.1 Radio Receiver
Series and parallel resonant circuits are commonly used in radio and TVreceivers to tune in stations and to separate the audio signal from theradio-frequency carrier wave. As an example, consider the block diagram14.12ale29559_ch14.qxd  07/17/2008  01:54 PM  Page 657
of an AM radio receiver shown in Fig. 14.62. Incoming amplitude-
modulated radio waves (thousands of them at different frequenciesfrom different broadcasting stations) are received by the antenna. Aresonant circuit (or a bandpass ﬁlter) is needed to select just one of theincoming waves. The selected signal is very weak and is ampliﬁed instages in order to generate an audible audio-frequency wave. Thus, wehave the radio frequency (RF) ampliﬁer to amplify the selected broad-cast signal, the intermediate frequency (IF) ampliﬁer to amplify aninternally generated signal based on the RF signal, and the audio ampli-ﬁer to amplify the audio signal just before it reaches the loudspeaker.It is much easier to amplify the signal at three stages than to build anampliﬁer to provide the same ampliﬁcation for the entire band.658 Chapter 14 Frequency Response

Asimpliﬁed block diagram of a superheterodyne AM radio receiver.
The type of AM receiver shown in Fig. 14.62 is known as the super-
heterodyne r eceiver. In the early development of radio, each ampliﬁca-
tion stage had to be tuned to the frequency of the incoming signal. This
way, each stage must have several tuned circuits to cover the entire AMband (540 to 1600 kHz). To avoid the problem of having several reso-nant circuits, modern receivers use a frequency mixer or heterodyne cir-
cuit, which always produces the same IF signal (445 kHz) but retainsthe audio frequencies carried on the incoming signal. To produce theconstant IF frequency, the rotors of two separate variable capacitors aremechanically coupled with one another so that they can be rotatedsimultaneously with a single control; this is called ganged tuning. Alocal oscillator ganged with the RF ampliﬁer produces an RF signal that
is combined with the incoming wave by the frequency mixer to producean output signal that contains the sum and the difference frequencies ofthe two signals. For example, if the resonant circuit is tuned to receive an800-kHz incoming signal, the local oscillator must produce a 1,255-kHzsignal, so that the sum and the difference
of frequencies are available at the output of 455 kHz) (1,255 /H11002800/H11005(1,255 /H11001800/H110052,055 kHz)ale29559_ch14.qxd  07/10/2008  03:50 PM  Page 658

14.12 Applications 659
the mixer. However, only the difference, 455 kHz, is used in practice.
This is the only frequency to which all the IF ampliﬁer stages are tuned,regardless of the station dialed. The original audio signal (containingthe “intelligence”) is extracted in the detector stage. The detector basi-cally removes the IF signal, leaving the audio signal. The audio signalis ampliﬁed to drive the loudspeaker, which acts as a transducer con-verting the electrical signal to sound.
Our major concern here is the tuning circuit for the AM radio
receiver. The operation of the FM radio receiver is different from thatof the AM receiver discussed here, and in a much different range offrequencies, but the tuning is similar.

14.12.2 Touch-Tone Telephone
Atypical application of filtering is the touch-tone telephone set
shown in Fig. 14.64. The keypad has 12 buttons arranged in four rows
and three columns. The arrangement provides 12 distinct signals byusing seven tones divided into two groups: the low-frequency group(697 to 941 Hz) and the high-frequency group (1,209 to 1,477 Hz).Pressing a button generates a sum of two sinusoids correspondingto its unique pair of frequencies. For example, pressing the number6 button generates sinusoidal tones with frequencies 770 Hz and1,477 Hz.660 Chapter 14 Frequency Response

When a caller dials a telephone number, a set of signals is trans-
mitted to the telephone office, where the touch-tone signals are
decoded by detecting the frequencies they contain. Figure 14.65shows the block diagram for the detection scheme. The signals areﬁrst ampliﬁed and separated into their respective groups by the low-pass (LP) and highpass (HP) ﬁlters. The limiters (L) are used to con-vert the separated tones into square waves. The individual tones areidentiﬁed using seven bandpass (BP) ﬁlters, each ﬁlter passing onetone and rejecting other tones. Each ﬁlter is followed by a detector(D), which is energized when its input voltage exceeds a certainlevel. The outputs of the detectors provide the required dc signalsneeded by the switching system to connect the caller to the partybeing called.ale29559_ch14.qxd  07/10/2008  03:50 PM  Page 660

14.12.3 Crossover Network
Another typical application of ﬁlters is the crossover network that
couples an audio ampliﬁer to woofer and tweeter speakers, as shown
in Fig. 14.66(a). The network basically consists of one highpass RCUsing the standard 600- resistor used in telephone circuits and a
series RLC circuit, design the bandpass ﬁlter in Fig. 14.65.
Solution:The bandpass ﬁlter is the series RLC circuit in Fig. 14.35. Since 
passes frequencies 697 Hz to 852 Hz and is centered at Hz,its bandwidth is

ﬁlter and one lowpass RLﬁlter. It routes frequencies higher than a
prescribed crossover frequency to the tweeter (high-frequency
loudspeaker) and frequencies below into the woofer (low-frequencyloudspeaker). These loudspeakers have been designed to accommo-date certain frequency responses. A woofer is a low-frequency loud-speaker designed to reproduce the lower part of the frequency range,up to about 3 kHz. A tweeter can reproduce audio frequencies fromabout 3 kHz to about 20 kHz. The two speaker types can be com-bined to reproduce the entire audio range of interest and provide theoptimum in frequency response.
By replacing the ampliﬁer with a voltage source, the approximate
equivalent circuit of the crossover network is shown in Fig. 14.66(b),where the loudspeakers are modeled by resistors. As a highpass ﬁlter,the transfer function is given by
(14.87)
Similarly, the transfer function of the lowpass ﬁlter is given by
(14.88)
The values of L, and C may be selected such that the two ﬁlters
have the same cutoff frequency, known as the crossover frequency , as
shown in Fig. 14.67.
The principle behind the crossover network is also used in the res-
onant circuit for a TV receiver, where it is necessary to separate thevideo and audio bands of RF carrier frequencies. The lower-frequencyband (picture information in the range from about 30 Hz to about4MHz) is channeled into the receiver’s video ampliﬁer, while the high-
frequency band (sound information around 4.5 MHz) is channeled tothe receiver’s sound ampliﬁer.R

14.13 Summary 663
Summary
1. The transfer function is the ratio of the output response 
to the input excitation ; that is, 
2. The frequency response is the variation of the transfer function
with frequency.
3.Zeros of a transfer function are the values of that make
while poles are the values of s that make 
4. The decibel is the unit of logarithmic gain. For a voltage or current
gain G, its decibel equivalent is 
5.Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude and phase of the
transfer function as it varies with frequency. The straight-lineapproximations of H (in dB) and (in degrees) are constructed
using the corner frequencies deﬁned by the poles and zeros of 
6.The resonant frequency is that frequency at which the imaginary partof a transfer function vanishes. For series and parallel RLC circuits.
7. The half-power frequencies are those frequencies at which
the power dissipated is one-half of that dissipated at the resonantfrequency. The geometric mean between the half-power frequen-cies is the resonant frequency, or
8.The bandwidth is the frequency band between half-powerfrequencies:
9. The quality factor is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance
peak. It is the ratio of the resonant (angular) frequency to thebandwidth,
10. A ﬁlter is a circuit designed to pass a band of frequencies and
reject others. Passive ﬁlters are constructed with resistors, capaci-tors, and inductors. Active ﬁlters are constructed with resistors,capacitors, and an active device, usually an op amp.
11.Four common types of ﬁlters are lowpass, highpass, bandpass, andbandstop.

frequencies are outside a prescribed range 
12.Scaling is the process whereby unrealistic element values are
magnitude-scaled by a factor and/or frequency-scaled by a fac-tor to produce realistic values.
13.PSpice can be used to obtain the frequency response of a circuit
if a frequency range for the response and the desired number ofpoints within the range are speciﬁed in the AC Sweep.
14.The radio receiver—one practical application of resonant circuits—employs a bandpass resonant circuit to tune in one frequencyamong all the broadcast signals picked up by the antenna.
15.The touch-tone telephone and the crossover network are two typi-cal applications of ﬁlters. The touch-tone telephone system employsﬁlters to separate tones of different frequencies to activate elec-tronic switches. The crossover network separates signals in differ-ent frequency ranges so that they can be delivered to differentdevices such as tweeters and woofers in a loudspeaker system.R¿/H11005K

ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.h), “the broad education necessary
to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a
global and societal context.”
As a student, you must make sure you acquire “the broad education
necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a globaland societal context.” To some extent, if you are already enrolled in anABET-accredited engineering program, then some of the courses youare required to take must meet this criteria. My recommendation is thateven if you are in such a program, you look at all the elective coursesyou take to make sure that you expand your awareness of global issuesand societal concerns. The engineers of the future must fully under-stand that they and their activities affect all of us in one way or another.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.i), “need for, and an ability to
engage in life-long learning.”
You must be fully aware of and recognize the “need for, and an abil-
ity to engage in life-long learning.” It almost seems absurd that thisneed and ability must be stated. Yet, you would be surprised at howmany engineers do not really understand this concept. The only way tobe really able to keep up with the explosion in technology we are fac-ing now and will be facing in the future is through constant learning.This learning must include nontechnical issues as well as the latesttechnology in your ﬁeld.
The best way to keep up with the state of the art in your ﬁeld is
through your colleagues and association with individuals you meetthrough your technical organization or organizations (especially IEEE).Reading state-of-the-art technical articles is the next best way to staycurrent.

Introduction
Our goal in this and the following chapters is to develop techniques
for analyzing circuits with a wide variety of inputs and responses. Suchcircuits are modeled by differential equations whose solutions describe
the total response behavior of the circuits. Mathematical methods havebeen devised to systematically determine the solutions of differentialequations. We now introduce the powerful method of Laplace trans-
formation, which involves turning differential equations into algebraic
equations, thus greatly facilitating the solution process.
The idea of transformation should be familiar by now. When using
phasors for the analysis of circuits, we transform the circuit fromthe time domain to the frequency or phasor domain. Once we obtainthe phasor result, we transform it back to the time domain. The Laplacetransform method follows the same process: we use the Laplace trans-formation to transform the circuit from the time domain to the fre-quency domain, obtain the solution, and apply the inverse Laplacetransform to the result to transform it back to the time domain.
The Laplace transform is signiﬁcant for a number of reasons. First,
it can be applied to a wider variety of inputs than phasor analysis. Sec-ond, it provides an easy way to solve circuit problems involving ini-tial conditions, because it allows us to work with algebraic equationsinstead of differential equations. Third, the Laplace transform is capa-ble of providing us, in one single operation, the total response of thecircuit comprising both the natural and forced responses.
We begin with the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform which gives
rise to its most essential properties. By examining these properties, weshall see how and why the method works. This also helps us to betterappreciate the idea of mathematical transformations. We also considersome properties of the Laplace transform that are very helpful in circuitanalysis. We then consider the inverse Laplace transform, transfer func-tions, and convolution. In this chapter, we will focus on the mechan-ics of the Laplace transformation. In Chapter 16 we will examine how15.1676 Chapter 15 Introduction to the Laplace Transform
Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827), a French astronomer and mathe-
matician, ﬁrst presented the transform that bears his name and its
applications to dif ferential equations in 1779.
Born of humble origins in Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy, France,
Laplace became a professor of mathematics at the age of 20. His math-ematical abilities inspired the famous mathematician Simeon Poisson,who called Laplace the Isaac Newton of France. He made importantcontributions in potential theory, probability theory, astronomy, andcelestial mechanics. He was widely known for his work, Traite de
Mecanique Celeste (Celestial Mechanics), which supplemented thework of Newton on astronomy. The Laplace transform, the subject ofthis chapter, is named after him.

the Laplace transform is applied in circuit analysis, network stability,
and network synthesis.
Deﬁnition of the Laplace Transform
Given a function f (t), its Laplace transform, denoted by F(s) or 
is deﬁned by
(15.1)
where sis a complex variable given by
(15.2)
Since the argument stof the exponent e in Eq. (15.1) must be dimen-
sionless, it follows that s has the dimensions of frequency and units of
inverse seconds or “frequency.” In Eq. (15.1), the lower limit isspeciﬁed as to indicate a time just before . We use as thelower limit to include the origin and capture any discontinuity of f(t) at
; this will accommodate functions—such as singularity functions—
that may be discontinuous at .
It should be noted that the integral in Eq. (15.1) is a deﬁnite inte-
gral with respect to time. Hence, the result of integration is indepen-dent of time and only involves the variable “s.”
Equation (15.1) illustrates the general concept of transformation.
The function f(t) is transformed into the function F(s). Whereas the
former function involves t as its argument, the latter involves s. We say
the transformation is from t-domain to s-domain. Given the interpreta-
tion of s as frequency, we arrive at the following description of the
Laplace transform:t/H110050t/H1100500

0/H11002  f (t)e/H11002st dtL[ f  (t)],15.215.2 Deﬁnition of the Laplace Transform 677
For an ordinary function f(t), the lower
limit can be replaced by 0.
The Laplace transform is an integral transformation of a function f(t)
from the time domain into the complex frequency domain, giving F(s).
When the Laplace transform is applied to circuit analysis, the dif-
ferential equations represent the circuit in the time domain. The terms
in the differential equations take the place of f(t). Their Laplace trans-
form, which corresponds to F(s), constitutes algebraic equations rep-
resenting the circuit in the frequency domain.
We assume in Eq. (15.1) that f (t) is ignored for To ensure
that this is the case, a function is often multiplied by the unit step.Thus, f(t) is written as f (t)u(t) or f (t), 
The Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is known as the one-sided (or
unilateral) Laplace transform. The two-sided (or bilateral) Laplace
transform is given by
(15.3)
The one-sided Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1), being adequate for ourpurposes, is the only type of Laplace transform that we will treat inthis book.F(s)/H11005

Afunction f(t) may not have a Laplace transform. In order for f (t)
to have a Laplace transform, the integral in Eq. (15.1) must converge
to a ﬁnite value. Since for any value of t, the integral con-
verges when
(15.4)
for some real value Thus, the region of convergence for theLaplace transform is as shown in Fig. 15.1. In this
region, and F(s) exists. F (s) is undefined outside the
region of convergence. Fortunately, all functions of interest in circuitanalysis satisfy the convergence criterion in Eq. (15.4) and haveLaplace transforms. Therefore, it is not necessary to specify inwhat follows.
Acompanion to the direct Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is the
inverse Laplace transform given by
(15.5)
where the integration is performed along a straight line (
) in the region of convergence, . See Fig. 15.1. The
direct application of Eq. (15.5) involves some knowledge about com-plex analysis beyond the scope of this book. For this reason, we willnot use Eq. (15.5) to ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform. We will ratheruse a look-up table, to be developed in Section 15.3. The functions f(t)
and F(s) are regarded as a Laplace transform pair where
(15.6)
meaning that there is one-to-one correspondence between f(t) and
F(s). The following examples derive the Laplace transforms of some
important functions.f

Properties of the Laplace Transform
The properties of the Laplace transform help us to obtain transform
pairs without directly using Eq. (15.1) as we did in Examples 15.1 and15.2. As we derive each of these properties, we should keep in mindthe deﬁnition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).15.3ale29559_ch15.qxd  07/22/2008  01:19 PM  Page 679

property of the Laplace transform. The proof of Eq. (15.7) followsreadily from the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).
For example, by the linearity property in Eq. (15.7), we may write

the dummy variable t is replaced by x. Hence, we obtain the scaling
property as

If F(s) is the Laplace transform of f (t), then
Taking the derivative with respect to s,

Time Periodicity
If function f (t) is a periodic function such as shown in Fig. 15.3, it can
be represented as the sum of time-shifted functions shown in Fig. 15.4.

We now transform each term in Eq. (15.36) and apply the time-shift
property in Eq. (15.17). We obtain

the transform f (t) deﬁned over its ﬁrst period only. Equation (15.40)
shows that the Laplace transform of a periodic function is the trans-form of the ﬁrst period of the function divided by 
Initial and Final Values
The initial-value and ﬁnal-value properties allow us to ﬁnd the initialvalue and the ﬁnal value of f (t) directly from its Laplace
transform F(s). To obtain these properties, we begin with the differen-
tiation property in Eq. (15.23), namely,
(15.41)
If we let the integrand in Eq. (15.41) vanishes due to the damp-ing exponential factor, and Eq. (15.41) becomes
Since is independent of s, we can write
(15.42)
This is known as the initial-value theorem. For example, we know from
Eq. (15.21a) that

In Eq. (15.41), we let then
or
(15.44)
This is referred to as the ﬁnal-value theorem. In order for the ﬁnal-
value theorem to hold, all poles of F(s) must be located in the left
half of the splane (see Fig. 15.1 or Fig. 15.9); that is, the poles must
have negative real parts. The only exception to this requirement isthe case in which F (s) has a simple pole at because the effect
of will be nulliﬁed by in Eq. (15.44). For example, fromEq. (15.21b),
(15.45)
Applying the ﬁnal-value theorem,
as expected from the given f(t). As another example,
(15.46)
so thatThis is incorrect, because oscillates between and and
does not have a limit as Thus, the ﬁnal-value theorem cannotbe used to ﬁnd the ﬁnal value of because F(s) has poles at
which are not in the left half of the s plane. In general, the ﬁnal-
value theorem does not apply in ﬁnding the ﬁnal values of sinusoidalfunctions—these functions oscillate forever and do not have ﬁnal values.
The initial-value and ﬁnal-value theorems depict the relationship
between the origin and inﬁnity in the time domain and the s-domain.
They serve as useful checks on Laplace transforms.
Table 15.1 provides a list of the properties of the Laplace trans-
form. The last property (on convolution) will be proved in Sec-tion 15.5. There are other properties, but these are enough for presentpurposes. Table 15.2 summarizes the Laplace transforms of somecommon functions. We have omitted the factor u(t) except where it
is necessary.
We should mention that many software packages, such as Math-
cad, MATLAB , Maple, and Mathematica, offer symbolic math. For
example, Mathcad has symbolic math for the Laplace, Fourier, and Z
transforms as well as the inverse function.s/H11005/H11006  j,f

The Inverse Laplace Transform
Given F(s), how do we transform it back to the time domain and obtain
the corresponding f (t)? By matching entries in Table 15.2, we avoid
using Eq. (15.5) to ﬁnd f(t).
Suppose F(s) has the general form of
(15.47)
where N(s) is the numerator polynomial and D(s) is the denominator
polynomial. The roots of are called the zeros of F(s), while
the roots of are the poles of F(s). Although Eq. (15.47) is
similar in form to Eq. (14.3), here F(s) is the Laplace transform of a
function, which is not necessarily a transfer function. We use partial
fraction expansion to break F(s) down into simple terms whose inverse
transform we obtain from Table 15.2. Thus, ﬁnding the inverse Laplace
transform of F(s) involves two steps.D(s) /H110050N(s) /H110050F(s)/H11005N(s)
D(s)15.4
Software packages such as MATLAB ,
Mathcad, and Maple are capable of
ﬁnding partial fraction expansionsquite easily.
Steps to Find the Inverse Laplace Transform:
1.Decompose F(s) into simple terms using partial fraction
expansion.
2. Find the inverse of each term by matching entries in Table 15.2.
Let us consider the three possible forms F(s) may take and how to
apply the two steps to each form.
15.4.1 Simple Poles
Recall from Chapter 14 that a simple pole is a ﬁrst-order pole. If F (s)
has only simple poles, then D(s) becomes a product of factors, so that
(15.48)
where are the simple poles, and for all
(i.e., the poles are distinct). Assuming that the degree of N(s) is i/HS11005jpi/HS11005pj s/H11005/H11002 p1, /H11002p 2,p, /H11002p nF(s)/H11005N(s)

  (s/H11001pn )Otherwise, we must ﬁrst apply long
division so that F(s)N(s)/H20862D(s)
Q(s)R(s)/H20862D(s), where the degree
ofR(s), the remainder of the long
division, is less than the degree of D(s)./H11001/H11005 /H11005ale29559_ch15.qxd  07/10/2008  04:06 PM  Page 690

less than the degree of D (s), we use partial fraction expansion to
decompose F(s) in Eq. (15.48) as
(15.49)
The expansion coefﬁcients are known as the residues of
F(s). There are many ways of ﬁnding the expansion coefﬁcients. One
way is using the r esidue method. If we multiply both sides of Eq. (15.49)
by we obtain
(15.50)
Since , setting in Eq. (15.50) leaves only on the
right-hand side of Eq. (15.50). Hence,
(15.51)
Thus, in general,
(15.52)
This is known as Heaviside’ s theorem. Once the values of are known,
we proceed to ﬁnd the inverse of F(s) using Eq. (15.49). Since the
inverse transform of each term in Eq. (15.49) is 
, then, from Table 15.2,
(15.53)
15.4.2 Repeated Poles
Suppose F(s) has n repeated poles at . Then we may represent
F(s) as
(15.54)
where is the remaining part of F(s) that does not have a pole at
We determine the expansion coefﬁcient as
(15.55)
as we did above. To determine , we multiply each term in Eq. (15.54)by and differentiate to get rid of , then evaluate the result at
to get rid of the other coefﬁcients except . Thus, we obtain

The mth term becomes
(15.58)
where . One can expect the differentiation to be dif-
ﬁcult to handle as m increases. Once we obtain the values of 
by partial fraction expansion, we apply the inverse transform
(15.59)
to each term on the right-hand side of Eq. (15.54) and obtain
(15.60)
15.4.3 Complex Poles
Apair of complex poles is simple if it is not repeated; it is a double
or multiple pole if repeated. Simple complex poles may be handled the
same way as simple real poles, but because complex algebra is involvedthe result is always cumbersome. An easier approach is a methodknown as completing the square . The idea is to express each complex
pole pair (or quadratic term) in D (s) as a complete square such as
and then use Table 15.2 to ﬁnd the inverse of the term.
Since N(s) and D(s) always have real coefﬁcients and we know
that the complex roots of polynomials with real coefﬁcients must occurin conjugate pairs, F(s) may have the general form
(15.61)
where is the remaining part of F(s) that does not have this pair
of complex poles. If we complete the square by letting
(15.62)
and we also let
(15.63)
then Eq. (15.61) becomes
(15.64)
From Table 15.2, the inverse transform is
(15.65)
The sine and cosine terms can be combined using Eq. (9.11).
Whether the pole is simple, repeated, or complex, a general
approach that can always be used in ﬁnding the expansion coefﬁcientsf

is the method of algebra, illustrated in Examples 15.9 to 15.11. To
apply the method, we ﬁrst set equal to an expansioncontaining unknown constants. We multiply the result through by acommon denominator. Then we determine the unknown constants byequating coefﬁcients (i.e., by algebraically solving a set of simultaneousequations for these coefﬁcients at like powers of s).
Another general approach is to substitute speciﬁc, convenient val-
ues of s to obtain as many simultaneous equations as the number of
unknown coefﬁcients, and then solve for the unknown coefﬁcients. Wemust make sure that each selected value of sis not one of the poles of
F(s). Example 15.11 illustrates this idea.F(s)/H11005N(s)/H20862D(s)

will not do so, to avoid complex algebra. Rather, we can substitute two
speciﬁc values of s[say , 1, which are not poles of F(s)] into

It is alright to leave the result this way. However, we can combine the
cosine and sine terms as

The Convolution Integral
The term convolution means “folding.” Convolution is an invaluable tool
to the engineer because it provides a means of viewing and characteriz-
ing physical systems. For example, it is used in ﬁnding the response y(t)
of a system to an excitation x (t), knowing the system impulse response
h(t). This is achieved through the convolution integral , deﬁned as
(15.66)
or simply
(15.67)
where is a dummy variable and the asterisk denotes convolution. Equa-tion (15.66) or (15.67) states that the output is equal to the input convolvedwith the unit impulse response. The convolution process is commutative:
(15.68a)
or
(15.68b)
This implies that the order in which the two functions are convolvedis immaterial. We will see shortly how to take advantage of this com-mutative property when performing graphical computation of the con-volution integral.y(t)/H11005

698 Chapter 15 Introduction to the Laplace Transform
The convolution of two signals consists of time-reversing one of the
signals, shifting it, and multiplying it point by point with the second
signal, and integrating the product.
The convolution integral in Eq. (15.66) is the general one; it
applies to any linear system. However, the convolution integral can be
simpliﬁed if we assume that a system has two properties. First, if
for then
(15.69)
Second, if the system’s impulse response is causal (i.e., for
), then for or , so that Eq. (15.69)
becomes
(15.70)
Here are some properties of the convolution integral.

Before learning how to evaluate the convolution integral in
Eq. (15.70), let us establish the link between the Laplace transform and
the convolution integral. Given two functions and with Laplacetransforms and , respectively, their convolution is
(15.71)
Taking the Laplace transform gives
(15.72)
To prove that Eq. (15.72) is true, we begin with the fact that 
is deﬁned as

Steps to Evaluate the Convolution Integral:
1. Folding: Take the mirror image of about the ordinate axis
to obtain .
2. Displacement: Shift or delay by tto obtain .
3. Multiplication: Find the product of and .

brackets can be written as
(15.75)
Substituting Eq. (15.75) into Eq. (15.74) gives
(15.76)
Interchanging the order of integration results in
(15.77)
The integral in brackets extends only from 0 to tbecause the delayed
unit step for and for . We notice
that the integral is the convolution of and as in Eq. (15.71).Hence,
(15.78)
as desired. This indicates that convolution in the time domain is equiv-alent to multiplication in the s-domain. For example, if and
, applying the property in Eq. (15.78), we get
(15.79)
Although we can find the convolution of two signals using
Eq. (15.78), as we have just done, if the product is verycomplicated, ﬁnding the inverse may be tough. Also, there are situa-tions in which and are available in the form of experimentaldata and there are no explicit Laplace transforms. In these cases, onemust do the convolution in the time domain.
The process of convolving two signals in the time domain is bet-
ter appreciated from a graphical point of view. The graphical proce-dure for evaluating the convolution integral in Eq. (15.70) usuallyinvolves four steps.f

The folding operation in step 1 is the reason for the term convolution.
The function scans or slides over . In view of this
superposition procedure, the convolution integral is also known as the
superposition integral.
To apply the four steps, it is necessary to be able to sketch 
and . To get from the original function x(t) involves
merely replacing every t with . Sketching is the key to the
convolution process. It involves reﬂecting about the vertical axisand shifting it by t. Analytically, we obtain by replacing every
tin h(t) by . Since convolution is commutative, it may be more
convenient to apply steps 1 and 2 to x(t) instead of h (t). The best way
to illustrate the procedure is with some examples.t/H11002lh

Find the convolution of the two signals in Fig. 15.10.
Solution:
We follow the four steps to get . First, we fold 
as shown in Fig. 15.11(a) and shift it by tas shown in Fig. 15.11(b).
For different values of t , we now multiply the two functions and
integrate to determine the area of the overlapping region.
For , there is no overlap of the two functions, as shown
in Fig. 15.12(a). Hence,
(15.12.1)
For , the two signals overlap between 1 and t, as shown in
Fig. 15.12(b).
(15.12.2)
For , the two signals completely overlap between and t, as shown in Fig. 15.12(c). It is easy to see that the area under
the curve is 2. Or

from one range of t to another. The result in Eq. (15.12.6) can be

is also speciﬁed.io(t)Example 15.14ale29559_ch15.qxd  07/10/2008  04:06 PM  Page 703

2.Present. We are to use the convolution integral to solve for the
response due to shown in Fig. 15.21(b).
3.Alternative. We have learned to do convolution by using the
convolution integral and how to do it graphically. In addition,
we could always work in the s-domain to solve for the current.
We will solve for the current using the convolution integral and
then check it using the graphical approach.
4.Attempt. As we stated, this problem can be solved in two
ways: directly using the convolution integral or using thegraphical technique. To use either approach, we ﬁrst needthe unit impulse response h(t) of the circuit. In the s -domain,
applying the current division principle to the circuit inFig. 15.22(a) gives
Hence,

Application to Integrodifferential
Equations
The Laplace transform is useful in solving linear integrodifferential
equations. Using the differentiation and integration properties of Laplacetransforms, each term in the integrodifferential equation is transformed.15.6ale29559_ch15.qxd  07/10/2008  04:06 PM  Page 705

Initial conditions are automatically taken into account. We solve the
resulting algebraic equation in the s-domain. We then convert the solution
back to the time domain by using the inverse transform. The follow-ing examples illustrate the process.706 Chapter 15 Introduction to the Laplace Transform

Summary
1. The Laplace transform allows a signal represented by a function
in the time domain to be analyzed in the s-domain (or complex
frequency domain). It is deﬁned as
2. Properties of the Laplace transform are listed in Table 15.1, while
the Laplace transforms of basic common functions are listed in
Table 15.2.
3. The inverse Laplace transform can be found using partial fraction
expansions and using the Laplace transform pairs in Table 15.2 asa look-up table. Real poles lead to exponential functions and com-plex poles to damped sinusoids.
4. The convolution of two signals consists of time-reversing one of
the signals, shifting it, multiplying it point by point with the sec-ond signal, and integrating the product. The convolution integralrelates the convolution of two signals in the time domain to theinverse of the product of their Laplace transforms:
5. In the time domain, the output y(t) of the network is the convolu-
tion of the impulse response with the input x(t),
Convolution may be regarded as the ﬂip-shift-multiply-time-areamethod.
6. The Laplace transform can be used to solve a linear integrodiffer-
ential equation.y(t)/H11005h

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Asking Questions
In over 30 years of teaching, I have struggled with determining how best
to help students learn. Regardless of how much time students spend instudying for a course, the most helpful activity for students is learning howto ask questions in class and then asking those questions. The student, byasking questions, becomes actively involved in the learning process and nolonger is merely a passive receptor of information. I think this activeinvolvement contributes so much to the learning process that it is probablythe single most important aspect to the development of a modern engineer.In fact, asking questions is the basis of science. As Charles P. Steinmetzrightly said, “No man really becomes a fool until he stops asking questions.”
It seems very straightforward and quite easy to ask questions. Have
we not been doing that all our lives? The truth is to ask questions inan appropriate manner and to maximize the learning process takessome thought and preparation.
Ia msure that there are several models one could effectively use. Let
me share what has worked for me. The most important thing to keep inmind is that you do not have to form a perfect question. Since the question-and-answer format allows the question to be developed in an iterative man-ner, the original question can easily be reﬁned as you go. I frequently tellstudents that they are most welcome to read their questions in class.
Here are three things you should keep in mind when asking ques-
tions. First, prepare your question. If you are like many students who areeither shy or have not learned to ask questions in class, you may wish tostart with a question you have written down outside of class. Second, waitfor an appropriate time to ask the question. Simply use your judgment onthat. Third, be prepared to clarify your question by paraphrasing it or say-ing it in a different way in case you are asked to repeat the question.

Steps in Applying the Laplace Transform:
1. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the s-domain.
2. Solve the circuit using nodal analysis, mesh analysis, source
transformation, superposition, or any circuit analysis techniquewith which we are familiar.
3. Take the inverse transform of the solution and thus obtain the
solution in the time domain.A system is a mathematical model of a physical process relating the
input to the output.One last comment: not all professors like students to ask questions
in class even though they may say they do. You need to ﬁnd out which
professors like classroom questions. Good luck in enhancing one ofyour most important skills as an engineer.
Introduction
Now that we have introduced the Laplace transform, let us see whatwe can do with it. Please keep in mind that with the Laplace transformwe actually have one of the most powerful mathematical tools foranalysis, synthesis, and design. Being able to look at circuits and sys-tems in the s-domain can help us to understand how our circuits andsystems really function. In this chapter we will take an in-depth lookat how easy it is to work with circuits in the s-domain. In addition, we
will brieﬂy look at physical systems. We are sure you have studiedsome mechanical systems and may have used the same differentialequations to describe them as we use to describe our electric circuits.Actually that is a wonderful thing about the physical universe in whichwe live; the same differential equations can be used to describe anylinear circuit, system, or process. The key is the term linear.16.1716 Chapter 16 Applications of the Laplace Transform
It is entirely appropriate to consider circuits as systems. Histori-
cally, circuits have been discussed as a separate topic from systems, so
we will actually talk about circuits and systems in this chapter realiz-ing that circuits are nothing more than a class of electrical systems.
The most important thing to remember is that everything we discussed
in the last chapter and in this chapter applies to any linear system. In thelast chapter, we saw how we can use Laplace transforms to solve lineardifferential equations and integral equations. In this chapter, we introducethe concept of modeling circuits in the s-domain. We can use that princi-
ple to help us solve just about any kind of linear circuit. We will take aquick look at how state variables can be used to analyze systems with mul-tiple inputs and multiple outputs. Finally, we examine how the Laplacetransform is used in network stability analysis and in network synthesis.
Circuit Element Models
Having mastered how to obtain the Laplace transform and its inverse,we are now prepared to employ the Laplace transform to analyze cir-cuits. This usually involves three steps.16.2ale29559_ch16.qxd  07/10/2008  04:11 PM  Page 716

Only the ﬁrst step is new and will be discussed here. As we did in pha-
sor analysis, we transform a circuit in the time domain to the frequencyor s-domain by Laplace transforming each term in the circuit.
For a resistor, the voltage-current relationship in the time domain is
(16.1)
Taking the Laplace transform, we get
(16.2)
For an inductor,
(16.3)
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides gives
(16.4)
or
(16.5)
The s-domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.1, where the initial con-
dition is modeled as a voltage or current source.
For a capacitor,
(16.6)
which transforms into the s-domain as
(16.7)
or
(16.8)
The s-domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.2. With the s-domain
equivalents, the Laplace transform can be used readily to solve ﬁrst- andV(s) /H110051

s-domain.

second-order circuits such as those we considered in Chapters 7 and 8.
We should observe from Eqs. (16.3) to (16.8) that the initial conditions
are part of the transformation. This is one advantage of using theLaplace transform in circuit analysis. Another advantage is that a com-plete response—transient and steady state—of a network is obtained.We will illustrate this with Examples 16.2 and 16.3. Also, observe the
duality of Eqs. (16.5) and (16.8), conﬁrming what we already knowfrom Chapter 8 (see Table 8.1), namely, that Land C, I(s) and V(s),
and and are dual pairs.
If we assume zero initial conditions for the inductor and the capac-
itor, the above equations reduce to:
(16.9)
The s-domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.3.
We deﬁne the impedance in the s-domain as the ratio of the volt-
age transform to the current transform under zero initial conditions;that is,
(16.10)
Thus, the impedances of the three circuit elements are
(16.11)
Table 16.1 summarizes these. The admittance in the s-domain is the
reciprocal of the impedance, or
(16.12)
The use of the Laplace transform in circuit analysis facilitates the useof various signal sources such as impulse, step, ramp, exponential, andsinusoidal.
The models for dependent sources and op amps are easy to develop
drawing from the simple fact that if the Laplace transform of f (t) is
F(s), then the Laplace transform of af (t) is aF(s)—the linearity prop-
erty. The dependent source model is a little easier in that we deal witha single value. The dependent source can have only two controllingvalues, a constant times either a voltage or a current. Thus,
(16.13)
(16.14)
The ideal op amp can be treated just like a resistor. Nothing within
an op amp, either real or ideal, does anything more than multiply a
voltage by a constant. Thus, we only need to write the equations as wealways do using the constraint that the input voltage to the op amp hasto be zero and the input current has to be zero.L[ai(t)] /H11005aI(s)L[av(t)] /H11005aV(s)Y(s) /H110051

Find in the circuit of Fig. 16.4, assuming zero initial conditions.
Solution:
We ﬁrst transform the circuit from the time domain to the s-domain.
The resulting s -domain circuit is in Fig. 16.5. We now apply mesh
analysis. For mesh 1,

Circuit Analysis
Circuit analysis is again relatively easy to do when we are in the
s-domain. We merely need to transform a complicated set of mathe-matical relationships in the time domain into the s-domain where we
convert operators (derivatives and integrals) into simple multipliers ofsand This now allows us to use algebra to set up and solve our
circuit equations. The exciting thing about this is that allof the circuit
theorems and relationships we developed for dc circuits are perfectlyvalid in the s-domain.1/H20862s.16.3722 Chapter 16 Applications of the Laplace Transform

Transfer Functions
The transfer function is a key concept in signal processing because it
indicates how a signal is processed as it passes through a network. It
is a ﬁtting tool for ﬁnding the network response, determining (ordesigning for) network stability, and network synthesis. The transferfunction of a network describes how the output behaves with respectto the input. It speciﬁes the transfer from the input to the output in thes-domain, assuming no initial energy.16.4726 Chapter 16 Applications of the Laplace Transform
For electrical networks, the transfer
function is also known as the network
function .
The transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the output response Y(s) to
the input excitation X(s), assuming all initial conditions are zero.
Thus,
(16.15)
The transfer function depends on what we deﬁne as input and output.
Since the input and output can be either current or voltage at any placein the circuit, there are four possible transfer functions:
(16.16a)
(16.16b)
(16.16c)
(16.16d)
Thus, a circuit can have many transfer functions. Note that H(s) is
dimensionless in Eqs. (16.16a) and (16.16b).
Each of the transfer functions in Eq. (16.16) can be found in two
ways. One way is to assume any convenient input X(s), use any cir-
cuit analysis technique (such as current or voltage division, nodal ormesh analysis) to ﬁnd the output Y(s), and then obtain the ratio of
the two. The other approach is to apply the ladder method , which
involves walking our way through the circuit. By this approach, weassume that the output is 1 V or 1 A as appropriate and use the basiclaws of Ohm and Kirchhoff (KCL only) to obtain the input. Thetransfer function becomes unity divided by the input. This approachmay be more convenient to use when the circuit has many loops ornodes so that applying nodal or mesh analysis becomes cumbersome.In the ﬁrst method, we assume an input and ﬁnd the output; in thesecond method, we assume the output and find the input. Inboth methods, we calculate H (s) as the ratio of output to input trans-
forms. The two methods rely on the linearity property, since we onlydeal with linear circuits in this book. Example 16.8 illustrates thesemethods.H(s) /H11005Admittance /H11005I(s)
V(s)H(s) /H11005Impedance /H11005V(s)
I(s)H(s) /H11005Current gain /H11005Io(s)
Ii(s)H(s) /H11005Voltage gain /H11005Vo(s)
Vi(s)H(s) /H11005Y(s)
X(s)
Some authors would not consider
Eqs. (16.16c) and (16.16d) transferfunctions.ale29559_ch16.qxd  07/10/2008  04:11 PM  Page 726

Equation (16.15) assumes that both X(s) and Y (s) are known.
Sometimes, we know the input X(s) and the transfer function H(s). We
ﬁnd the output Y(s) as
(16.17)
and take the inverse transform to get y(t). A special case is when the
input is the unit impulse function, so that For thiscase,
(16.18)
where
(16.19)
The term h(t) represents the unit impulse response—it is the time-domain
response of the network to a unit impulse. Thus, Eq. (16.19) provides anew interpretation for the transfer function: H(s) is the Laplace transform
of the unit impulse response of the network. Once we know the impulseresponse h(t) of a network, we can obtain the response of the network
to anyinput signal using Eq. (16.17) in the s-domain or using the con-
volution integral (section 15.5) in the time domain.h

For Practice Prob. 16.9. State Variables
Thus far in this book we have considered techniques for analyzing sys-
tems with only one input and only one output. Many engineering systemshave many inputs and many outputs, as shown in Fig. 16.21. The statevariable method is a very important tool in analyzing systems and under-standing such highly complex systems. Thus, the state variable model ismore general than the single-input, single-output model, such as a trans-fer function. Although the topic cannot be adequately covered in one chap-ter, let alone one section of a chapter, we will cover it brieﬂy at this point.16.5

In the state variable model, we specify a collection of variables
that describe the internal behavior of the system. These variables are
known as the state variables of the system. They are the variables that
determine the future behavior of a system when the present state ofthe system and the input signals are known. In other words, they arethose variables which, if known, allow all other system parameters tobe determined by using only algebraic equations.16.5 State Variables 731
A state variable is a physical property that characterizes the state of a
system, regardless of how the system got to that state.
Common examples of state variables are the pressure, volume, and
temperature. In an electric circuit, the state variables are the inductor
current and capacitor voltage since they collectively describe theenergy state of the system.
The standard way to represent the state equations is to arrange
them as a set of ﬁrst-order differential equations:
(16.20)
where
and the dot represents the ﬁrst derivative with respect to time, i.e.,
and
Aand Bare respectively and matrices. In addition to the
state equation in Eq. (16.20), we need the output equation. The com-
plete state model or state space is

Cand Dare, respectively, and matrices. For the special
case of single-input single-output, 
Assuming zero initial conditions, the transfer function of the sys-
tem is found by taking the Laplace transform of Eq. (16.21a); we obtain
or
(16.22)
where Iis the identity matrix. Taking the Laplace transform of
Eq. (16.21b) yields
(16.23)
Substituting Eq. (16.22) into Eq. (16.23) and dividing by Z(s) gives
the transfer function as
(16.24)
where
In most cases, so the degree of the numerator of H(s) in
Eq. (16.24) is less than that of the denominator. Thus,
(16.25)
Because of the matrix computation involved, MATLAB can be used to
ﬁnd the transfer function.

Steps to Apply the State Variable Method to
Circuit Analysis:
1. Select the inductor current i and capacitor voltage v as the state
variables, making sure they are consistent with the passive sign
convention.
2. Apply KCL and KVL to the circuit and obtain circuit variables
(voltages and currents) in terms of the state variables. Thisshould lead to a set of ﬁrst-order differential equations neces-sary and sufﬁcient to determine all state variables.
3. Obtain the output equation and put the ﬁnal result in state-space
representation.
Steps 1 and 3 are usually straightforward; the major task is in
step 2. We will illustrate this with examples.ale29559_ch16.qxd  07/10/2008  04:11 PM  Page 732

736 Chapter 16 Applications of the Laplace Transform
Assume we have a system where the output is y(t) and the input is z(t).
Let the following differential equation describe the relationship between
the input and the output.
(16.12.1)
Obtain the state model and the transfer function of the system.
Solution:
First, we select the state variables. Let therefore
(16.12.2)
Now let
(16.12.3)
Note that at this time we are looking at a second-order system thatwould normally have two ﬁrst-order terms in the solution.
Now we have where we can ﬁnd the value from
Eq. (16.12.1), i.e.,
(16.12.4)
From Eqs. (16.12.2) to (16.12.4), we can now write the followingmatrix equations:
(16.12.5)
(16.12.6)
We now obtain the transfer function.
The inverse is
The transfer function is
To check this, we directly apply the Laplace transfer to each term in
Eq. (16.12.1). Since initial conditions are zero, we get
which is in agreement with what we got previously.[s

Applications
So far we have considered three applications of Laplace’s transform:
circuit analysis in general, obtaining transfer functions, and solving lin-ear integrodifferential equations. The Laplace transform also ﬁndsapplication in other areas in circuit analysis, signal processing, and con-trol systems. Here we will consider two more important applications:network stability and network synthesis.
16.6.1 Network Stability
Acircuit is stable if its impulse response h(t) is bounded (i.e., h(t) con-
verges to a ﬁnite value) as ; it is unstable if h(t) grows without
bound as In mathematical terms, a circuit is stable when
(16.26)
Since the transfer function H (s) is the Laplace transform of the impulse
response must meet certain requirements in order forEq. (16.26) to hold. Recall that H(s) may be written as
(16.27)
where the roots of are called the zeros of H(s) because they
make while the roots of are called the poles of H(s)
since they cause The zeros and poles of H(s) are often located
in the s plane as shown in Fig. 16.26(a). Recall from Eqs. (15.47) and
(15.48) that H(s) may also be written in terms of its poles as
(16.28)
H(s) must meet two requirements for the circuit to be stable. First, thedegree of N(s) must be less than the degree of D(s); otherwise, long
division would produce
(16.29)
where the degree of R(s), the remainder of the long division, is less
than the degree of D(s). The inverse of H(s) in Eq. (16.29) does not
meet the condition in Eq. (16.26). Second, all the poles of H (s) inH(s) /H11005k

Eq. (16.27) (i.e., all the roots of ) must have negative real
parts; in other words, all the poles must lie in the left half of the splane,
as shown typically in Fig. 16.26(b). The reason for this will be appar-ent if we take the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) in Eq. (16.27).
Since Eq. (16.27) is similar to Eq. (15.48), its partial fraction expan-sion is similar to the one in Eq. (15.49) so that the inverse of H(s) is
similar to that in Eq. (15.53). Hence,
(16.30)
We see from this equation that each pole must be positive (i.e., pole
in the left-half plane) in order for to decrease with
increasing t. Thus,e

A circuit is stable when all the poles of its transfer function H(s) lie in
the left half of the splane.
An unstable circuit never reaches steady state because the transient
response does not decay to zero. Consequently, steady-state analysis is
only applicable to stable circuits.
Acircuit made up exclusively of passive elements ( and C)
and independent sources cannot be unstable, because that would implythat some branch currents or voltages would grow indeﬁnitely withsources set to zero. Passive elements cannot generate such indeﬁnitegrowth. Passive circuits either are stable or have poles with zero realparts. To show that this is the case, consider the series RLC circuit in
Fig. 16.27. The transfer function is given by
or
(16.31)
Notice that is the same as the charac-
teristic equation obtained for the series RLC circuit in Eq. (8.8). The
circuit has poles at

where
For the two poles always lie in the left half of the splane,
implying that the circuit is always stable. However, when 
and the circuit becomes unstable. Although ideally this is possible, itdoes not really happen, because Ris never zero.
On the other hand, active circuits or passive circuits with con-
trolled sources can supply energy, and they can be unstable. In fact,an oscillator is a typical example of a circuit designed to be unstable.An oscillator is designed such that its transfer function is of the form
(16.33)
so that its output is sinusoidal.

16.6.2 Network Synthesis
Network synthesis may be regarded as the process of obtaining an
appropriate network to represent a given transfer function. Networksynthesis is easier in the s-domain than in the time domain.
In network analysis, we ﬁnd the transfer function of a given net-
work. In network synthesis, we reverse the approach: given a transferfunction, we are required to ﬁnd a suitable network.
Network synthesis is ﬁnding a network that represents a given transfer
function.
Keep in mind that in synthesis, there may be many different
answers—or possibly no answers—because there are many circuits that
can be used to represent the same transfer function; in network analy-sis, there is only one answer.
Network synthesis is an exciting ﬁeld of prime engineering impor-
tance. Being able to look at a transfer function and come up with thetype of circuit it represents is a great asset to a circuit designer.Although network synthesis constitutes a whole course by itself andrequires some experience, the following examples are meant to whetyour appetite.ale29559_ch16.qxd  07/22/2008  01:15 PM  Page 740

Solution:
1.Deﬁne. The problem is clearly and completely deﬁned. This
problem is what we call a synthesis problem: given a transfer
function, synthesize a circuit that produces the given transferfunction. However, to keep the problem more manageable, wegive a circuit that produces the desired transfer function.
Had one of the variables, Rin this case, not been given a value,
then the problem would have had an inﬁnite number of answers.An open-ended problem of this kind would require some additionalassumptions that would have narrowed the set of solutions.
2.Present. Atransfer function of the voltage out versus the voltage
in is equal to A circuit, Fig. 16.30, is also
given that should be able to produce the required transfer function.Two different values of R , and are to be used to calculate
the values of L and Cthat produce the given transfer function.
3.Alternative. All solution paths involve determining the transfer
function of Fig. 16.30 and then matching the various terms ofthe transfer function. Two approaches would be to use meshanalysis or nodal analysis. Since we are looking for a ratio ofvoltages, nodal analysis makes the most sense.
4.Attempt. Using nodal analysis leads to

Solving for the transfer function by using mesh analysis seems
the most straightforward and the approach we could use here.However, it should be pointed out that this is mathematicallymore complex and will take longer than the original nodalanalysis approach. Other approaches also exist. We can assumean input for and, using either nodal analysisor mesh analysis, see if we get the same answer we would getwith just using the transfer function.

(16.16.5)
To synthesize the given transfer function T(s), compare it with the one
in Eq. (16.16.5). Notice two things: (1) must not involve sbecause
the numerator of T (s) is constant; (2) the given transfer function is
second-order, which implies that we must have two capacitors.
Therefore, we must make and resistive, while and arecapacitive. So we select
(16.16.6)
Substituting Eq. (16.16.6) into Eq. (16.16.5) gives
Comparing this with the given transfer function T(s), we notice that
If we select then
Thus, the given transfer function is realized using the circuit shown in

Summary
1. The Laplace transform can be used to analyze a circuit. We con-
vert each element from the time domain to the s-domain, solve the
problem using any circuit analysis technique, and convert the resultto the time domain using the inverse transform.
2. In the s-domain, the circuit elements are replaced with the initial
condition at as follows. (Please note, voltage models are t/H11005016.7ale29559_ch16.qxd  07/10/2008  04:11 PM  Page 745

given below, but the corresponding current models work equally
well.):
3. Using the Laplace transform to analyze a circuit results in a com-
plete (both transient and steady state) response because the initialconditions are incorporated in the transformation process.
4. The transfer function H(s) of a network is the Laplace transform
of the impulse response h(t).
5. In the s-domain, the transfer function H (s) relates the output
response Y(s) and an input excitation X(s); that is, 
6.The state variable model is a useful tool for analyzing complexsystems with several inputs and outputs. State variable analysis isa powerful technique that is most popularly used in circuit theoryand control. The state of a system is the smallest set of quantities(known as state variables) that we must know in order to deter-mine its future response to any given input. The state equation instate variable form is 
while the output equation is
7. For an electric circuit, we ﬁrst select capacitor voltages and induc-
tor current as state variables. We then apply KCL and KVL to
obtain the state equations.
8. Two other areas of applications of the Laplace transform covered
in this chapter are circuit stability and synthesis. A circuit is sta-ble when all the poles of its transfer function lie in the left half ofthe s plane. Network synthesis is the process of obtaining an appro-
priate network to represent a given transfer function for whichanalysis in the s-domain is well suited.y/H11005Cx/H11001Dzx#/H11005Ax/H11001BzH(s) /H11005Y(s)/H20862X(s). Capactior:

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.j), “a knowledge of contemporary
issues.”
Engineers must have knowledge of contemporary issues. To have a truly
meaningful career in the twenty-ﬁrst century, you must have knowl-edge of contemporary issues, especially those that may directly affectyour job and/or work. One of the easiest ways to achieve this is to reada lot—newspapers, magazines, and contemporary books. As a studentenrolled in an ABET-accredited program, some of the courses you takewill be directed toward meeting this criteria.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.k), “an ability to use the techniques,
skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for
engineering practice.”
The successful engineer must have the “ability to use the techniques,skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.”Clearly, a major focus of this textbook is to do just that. Learning touse skillfully the tools that facilitate your working in a modern “knowl-edge capturing integrated design environment” (KCIDE) is fundamen-tal to your performance as an engineer. The ability to work in a modernKCIDE environment requires a thorough understanding of the toolsassociated with that environment. 
The successful engineer, therefore, must keep abreast of the new
design, analysis, and simulation tools. That engineer must also usethose tools until he or she is comfortable with using them. The engineeralso must make sure software results are consistent with real-worldactualities. It is probably in this area that most engineers have the great-est difﬁculty. Thus, successful use of these tools requires constantlearning and relearning the fundamentals of the area in which the engi-neer is working.

Introduction
We have spent a considerable amount of time on the analysis of circuits
with sinusoidal sources. This chapter is concerned with a means of ana-
lyzing circuits with periodic, nonsinusoidal excitations. The notion ofperiodic functions was introduced in Chapter 9; it was mentioned therethat the sinusoid is the most simple and useful periodic function. Thischapter introduces the Fourier series, a technique for expressing a peri-odic function in terms of sinusoids. Once the source function is expressedin terms of sinusoids, we can apply the phasor method to analyze circuits.
The Fourier series is named after Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier
(1768–1830). In 1822, Fourier’s genius came up with the insight thatany practical periodic function can be represented as a sum of sinu-soids. Such a representation, along with the superposition theorem,allows us to ﬁnd the response of circuits to arbitrary periodic inputsusing phasor techniques.
We begin with the trigonometric Fourier series. Later we consider
the exponential Fourier series. We then apply Fourier series in circuitanalysis. Finally, practical applications of Fourier series in spectrumanalyzers and ﬁlters are demonstrated.
Trigonometric Fourier Series
While studying heat ﬂow, Fourier discovered that a nonsinusoidal peri-odic function can be expressed as an inﬁnite sum of sinusoidal func-tions. Recall that a periodic function is one that repeats every Tseconds.
In other words, a periodic function satisﬁes

Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830), a French mathemati-
cian, ﬁrst presented the series and transform that bear his name. Fourier’s
results were not enthusiastically received by the scientiﬁc world. Hecould not even get his work published as a paper.
Born in Auxerre, France, Fourier was orphaned at age 8. He attended
a local military college run by Benedictine monks, where he demon-strated great proﬁciency in mathematics. Like most of his contempo-raries, Fourier was swept into the politics of the French Revolution.He played an important role in Napoleon’s expeditions to Egypt in thelater 1790s. Due to his political involvement, he narrowly escapeddeath twice.

A software package like Mathcad or
Maple can be used to evaluate the
Fourier coefﬁcients.Historical note: Although Fourier
published his theorem in 1822, it was
P. G. L. Dirichlet (1805–1859) who later
supplied an acceptable proof of thetheorem.The harmonic frequency nis an
integral multiple of the fundamental
frequency , i.e., nn./H92750 /H11005/H9275 /H9275 0/H9275
The Fourier series of a periodic function f(t) is a representation that
resolves f(t) into a dc component and an ac component comprising
an inﬁnite series of harmonic sinusoids.According to the Fourier theorem, any practical periodic func-
tion of frequency can be expressed as an inﬁnite sum of sine or
cosine functions that are integral multiples of Thus, can beexpressed as

or
(17.3)
where is called the fundamental frequency in radians per
second. The sinusoid or is called the n th harmonic
of ; it is an odd harmonic if n is odd and an even harmonic if n
is even. Equation 17.3 is called the trigonometric Fourier series of
. The constants and are the Fourier coefﬁcients. The coef-
ﬁcient is the dc component or the average value of . (Recallthat sinusoids have zero average values.) The coefﬁcients and (for ) are the amplitudes of the sinusoids in the ac component.Thus,n/HS110050b

Afunction that can be represented by a Fourier series as in Eq. (17.3)
must meet certain requirements, because the inﬁnite series in Eq. (17.3)
may or may not converge. These conditions on to yield a convergentFourier series are as follows:
1. is single-valued everywhere.2. has a finite number of finite discontinuities in any one
period.
3. has a finite number of maxima and minima in any one
period.

necessary conditions, they are sufﬁcient conditions for a Fourier seriesto exist.

To evaluate we multiply both sides of Eq. (17.3) by 
and integrate over one period:
(17.7)
The integral containing is zero in view of Eq. (17.4b), while the
integral containing vanishes according to Eq. (17.4c). The integralcontaining will be zero except when in which case it is T/H208622,
according to Eqs. (17.4e) and (17.4g). Thus,
or
(17.8)
In a similar vein, we obtain by multiplying both sides of Eq. (17.3)
by and integrating over the period. The result is
(17.9)
Be aware that since is periodic, it may be more convenient to carry
the integrations above from to T/H208622 or generally from to 
instead of 0 to T. The result will be the same.
An alternative form of Eq. (17.3) is the amplitude-phase form 
(17.10)
We can use Eqs. (9.11) and (9.12) to relate Eq. (17.3) to Eq. (17.10),

Our goal is to obtain the Fourier coefﬁcients and using
Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). First, we describe the waveform as
(17.1.2)
and Since Thus,
(17.1.3)
Using Eq. (17.8) along with Eq. (17.15a),
(17.1.4)
From Eq. (17.9) with the aid of Eq. (17.15b),
(17.1.5)
Substituting the Fourier coefﬁcients in Eqs. (17.1.3) to (17.1.5) intoEq. (17.1.1) gives the Fourier series as
(17.1.6)
Since contains only the dc component and the sine terms with thefundamental component and odd harmonics, it may be written as
(17.1.7)
By summing the terms one by one as demonstrated in Fig. 17.2,
we notice how superposition of the terms can evolve into the originalsquare. As more and more Fourier components are added, the sum getscloser and closer to the square wave. However, it is not possible inpractice to sum the series in Eq. (17.1.6) or (17.1.7) to inﬁnity. Onlya partial sum ( , where N is ﬁnite) is possible. If we

Symmetry Considerations
We noticed that the Fourier series of Example 17.1 consisted only of
the sine terms. One may wonder if a method exists whereby one can
know in advance that some Fourier coefﬁcients would be zero andavoid the unnecessary work involved in the tedious process of calcu-lating them. Such a method does exist; it is based on recognizing theexistence of symmetry. Here we discuss three types of symmetry:(1) even symmetry, (2) odd symmetry, (3) half-wave symmetry.
17.3.1 Even Symmetry
Afunction is even if its plot is symmetrical about the vertical axis;
that is,

2–Examples of even functions are and Figure 17.10 shows
more examples of periodic even functions. Note that each of theseexamples satisﬁes Eq. (17.16). A main property of an even function
is that:
(17.17)
because integrating from to 0 is the same as integrating from 0to . Utilizing this property, the Fourier coefﬁcients for an even func-tion become
(17.18)
Since Eq. (17.3) becomes a Fourier cosine series. This makes
sense because the cosine function is itself even. It also makes intuitivesense that an even function contains no sine terms since the sine func-tion is odd.
To conﬁrm Eq. (17.18) quantitatively, we apply the property of an
even function in Eq. (17.17) in evaluating the Fourier coefﬁcients inEqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). It is convenient in each case to inte-grate over the interval which is symmetrical about
the origin. Thus,
(17.19)
We change variables for the integral over the interval 
by letting so that since is
an even function, and when Then,

because integration from to 0 is the negative of that from 0 to
. With this property, the Fourier coefﬁcients for an odd function
become
(17.28)
which give us a Fourier sine series. Again, this makes sense because
the sine function is itself an odd function. Also, note that there is no
dc term for the Fourier series expansion of an odd function.
The quantitative proof of Eq. (17.28) follows the same procedure
taken to prove Eq. (17.18) except that is now odd, so that
With this fundamental but simple difference, it is easy
to see that in Eq. (17.20), in Eq. (17.23a), and inEq. (17.24) becomes
(17.29)
as expected.
It is interesting to note that any periodic function with neither
even nor odd symmetry may be decomposed into even and odd parts.Using the properties of even and odd functions from Eqs. (17.16) and(17.26), we can write
(17.30)
Notice that satisfies the property of aneven function in Eq. (17.16), while satisﬁesthe property of an odd function in Eq. (17.26). The fact that contains only the dc term and the cosine terms, while has onlythe sine terms, can be exploited in grouping the Fourier series expan-sion of as

Typical examples of half-wave odd symmetric functions.Also, note the following properties of odd and even functions:
1. The product of two even functions is also an even function.
2. The product of two odd functions is an even function.3. The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd
function.
4. The sum (or difference) of two even functions is also an even
function.
5. The sum (or difference) of two odd functions is an odd function.6. The sum (or difference) of an even function and an odd function
is neither even nor odd.
Each of these properties can be proved using Eqs. (17.16) and (17.26).
17.3.3 Half-Wave Symmetry
Afunction is half-wave (odd) symmetric if
(17.32)
which means that each half-cycle is the mirror image of the next half-cycle. Notice that functions and satisfy Eq. (17.32)for odd values of n and therefore possess half-wave symmetry when n
is odd. Figure 17.12 shows other examples of half-wave symmetricfunctions. The functions in Figs. 17.11(a) and 17.11(b) are also half-wave symmetric. Notice that for each function, one half-cycle is theinverted version of the adjacent half-cycle. The Fourier coefﬁcientsbecome

To derive Eq. (17.33), we apply the property of half-wave sym-
metric functions in Eq. (17.32) in evaluating the Fourier coefﬁcients inEqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). Thus,

Circuit Applications
We ﬁnd that in practice, many circuits are driven by nonsinusoidal peri-
odic functions. To ﬁnd the steady-state response of a circuit to a non-
sinusoidal periodic excitation requires the application of a Fourierseries, ac phasor analysis, and the superposition principle. The proce-dure usually involves four steps.17.4
Steps for Applying Fourier Series:
1. Express the excitation as a Fourier series.
2. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the frequency
domain.
3. Find the response of the dc and ac components in the Fourier
series.
4. Add the individual dc and ac responses using the superposition
principle.Determine the Fourier series of the function in Fig. 17.12(a). Take

2 t774 Chapter 17 The Fourier Series
The ﬁrst step is to determine the Fourier series expansion of the
excitation. For the periodic voltage source shown in Fig. 17.18(a), for
example, the Fourier series is expressed as
(17.40)
(The same could be done for a periodic current source.) Equation (17.40)shows that v (t) consists of two parts: the dc component and the ac
component with several harmonics. This Fourier series rep-
resentation may be regarded as a set of series-connected sinusoidalsources, with each source having its own amplitude and frequency, asshown in Fig. 17.18(b).
The third step is ﬁnding the response to each term in the Fourier
series. The response to the dc component can be determined in theV

Average Power and RMS Values
Recall the concepts of average power and rms value of a periodic sig-
nal that we discussed in Chapter 11. To ﬁnd the average powerabsorbed by a circuit due to a periodic excitation, we write the voltageand current in amplitude-phase form [see Eq. (17.10)] as
(17.42)
(17.43)
Following the passive sign convention (Fig. 17.25), the average
power is
(17.44)
Substituting Eqs. (17.42) and (17.43) into Eq. (17.44) gives
(17.45)
The second and third integrals vanish, since we are integrating thecosine over its period. According to Eq. (17.4e), all terms in thefourth integral are zero when By evaluating the ﬁrst integraland applying Eq. (17.4g) to the fourth integral for the case we obtain
(17.46)
This shows that in average-power calculation involving periodic volt-age and current, the total average power is the sum of the average pow-ers in each harmonically related voltage and current.
Given a periodic function , its rms value (or the effective value)
is given by

Historical note: Named after the French
mathematician Marc-Antoine Parseval
Deschemes (1755–1836).Substituting in Eq. (17.10) into Eq. (17.47) and noting that
we obtain
(17.48)
Distinct integers nand mhave been introduced to handle the prod-
uct of the two series summations. Using the same reasoning as
above, we get
or
(17.49)
In terms of Fourier coefﬁcients and Eq. (17.49) may be written as
(17.50)
If is the current through a resistor R, then the power dissipated in
the resistor is
(17.51)
Or if is the voltage across a resistor R, the power dissipated in the
resistor is
(17.52)
One can avoid specifying the nature of the signal by choosing a 
resistance. The power dissipated by the resistance is
(17.53)
This result is known as Parseval’ s theorem. Notice that is the power
in the dc component, while is the ac power in the nth har-
monic. Thus, Parseval’s theorem states that the average power in a peri-odic signal is the sum of the average power in its dc component andthe average powers in its harmonics.1

This is expected, because the capacitor is an open circuit to dc and the
entire 2-A current ﬂows through the resistor. For

We obtain the average power supplied to the circuit by applying

To get the proper signs of and we have to compare vand iin this
example with Eqs. (17.42) and (17.43). Thus,
Alternatively, we can ﬁnd the average power absorbed by the resistor as
which is the same as the power supplied, since the capacitor absorbs

Fourier Analysis with PSpice
Fourier analysis is usually performed with PSpice in conjunction with
transient analysis. Therefore, we must do a transient analysis in order
to perform a Fourier analysis.
To perform the Fourier analysis of a waveform, we need a circuit
whose input is the waveform and whose output is the Fourier decom-position. A suitable circuit is a current (or voltage) source in series witha resistor as shown in Fig. 17.33. The waveform is inputted as
using VPULSE for a pulse or VSIN for a sinusoid, and the attri-
butes of the waveform are set over its period T. The output V(1) from
node 1 is the dc level and the ﬁrst nine harmonics with theircorresponding phases that is,
(17.73)
where
(17.74)
Notice in Eq. (17.74) that the PSpice output is in the sine and angle form
rather than the cosine and angle form in Eq. (17.10). The PSpice output
also includes the normalized Fourier coefﬁcients. Each coefﬁcient isnormalized by dividing it by the magnitude of the fundamental sothat the normalized component is The corresponding phase isnormalized by subtracting from it the phase of the fundamental, sothat the normalized phase is .
There are two types of Fourier analyses offered by PSpice for

A/D program. While DFT is an approximation of the exponential Fourier
series, FTT is an algorithm for rapid efﬁcient numerical computation of
DFT. A full discussion of DFT and FTT is beyond the scope of this book.
17.7.1 Discrete Fourier Transform
Adiscrete Fourier transform (DFT) is performed by the PSpice pro-
gram, which tabulates the harmonics in an output ﬁle. To enable aFourier analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/Transient and bring up the
Transient dialog box, shown in Fig. 17.34. The Print Step should be a
small fraction of the period T, while the Final Time could be 6T. The
Center Frequency is the fundamental frequency The partic-
ular variable whose DFT is desired, V(1) in Fig. 17.34, is entered inthe Output Vars command box. In addition to ﬁlling in the Transient
dialog box, DCLICK Enable Fourier. With the Fourier analysis enabled
and the schematic saved, run PSpice by selecting Analysis/Simulate
as usual. The program executes a harmonic decomposition into Fouriercomponents of the result of the transient analysis. The results are sentto an output ﬁle which can be retrieved by selecting Analysis/ExamineOutput. The output ﬁle includes the dc value and the ﬁrst nine har-monics by default, although you can specify more in the Number of
harmonics box (see Fig. 17.34).
17.7.2 Fast Fourier Transform
Afast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed by the PSpice A/D pro-
gram and displays as a PSpice A/D plot the complete spectrum of a
transient expression. As explained above, we ﬁrst construct the schematicin Fig. 17.33(b) and enter the attributes of the waveform. We also needto enter the Print Step and the Final Time in the Transient dialog box.
Once this is done, we can obtain the FFT of the waveform in two ways.
One way is to insert a voltage marker at node 1 in the schematic
of the circuit in Fig. 17.33(b). After saving the schematic and select-ing Analysis/Simulate , the waveform V(1) will be displayed in the
PSpice A/D window. Double clicking the FFT icon in the PSpice A/D
menu will automatically replace the waveform with its FFT. From theFFT-generated graph, we can obtain the harmonics. In case the FFT-generated graph is crowded, we can use the User Deﬁned data range
(see Fig. 17.35) to specify a smaller range.f

Example 17.12 Use PSpice to determine the Fourier coefﬁcients of the signal in Fig. 17.1.
Solution:
Figure 17.36 shows the schematic for obtaining the Fourier coefﬁcients.With the signal in Fig. 17.1 in mind, we enter the attributes of the
voltage source VPULSE as shown in Fig. 17.36. We will solve thisexample using both the DFT and FFT approaches.
■METHOD 1 DFT Approach: (The voltage marker in Fig. 17.36
is not needed for this method.) From Fig. 17.1, it is evident that 
So, in the transient dialog box, we select the Final Time as 
the Print Step as 0.01 s, the Step Ceiling as 10 ms, the Center
Frequency as 0.5 Hz, and the output variable as V(1). (In fact, Fig. 17.34
is for this particular example.) When PSpice is run, the output ﬁle
contains the following result:6T/H1100512 s,f0/H110051

Figure 17.36
Schematic for Example 17.12.Another way of obtaining the FFT of V(1) is to not insert a volt-
age marker at node 1 in the schematic. After selecting Analysis/
Simulate , the PSpice A/D window will come up with no graph on it.
We select Trace/Add and type V(1) in the Trace Command box and
DCLICKL OK . We now select Plot/X-Axis Settings to bring up the
X-Axis Setting dialog box shown in Fig. 17.35 and then select
Fourier/OK . This will cause the FFT of the selected trace (or traces)
to be displayed. This second approach is useful for obtaining the FFTof any trace associated with the circuit.
Amajor advantage of the FFT method is that it provides graphi-
cal output. But its major disadvantage is that some of the harmonicsmay be too small to see.
In both DFT and FFT, we should let the simulation run for a large
number of cycles and use a small value of Step Ceiling (in the Transient
dialog box) to ensure accurate results. The Final Time in the Tran-
sient dialog box should be at least ﬁve times the period of the signalto allow the simulation to reach steady state.17.7 Fourier Analysis with PSpice 789

has only odd harmonics with phase whereas PSpice seems
to indicate that the signal has even harmonics although the magnitudesof the even harmonics are small.

Fig. 17.37(a) on the PSpice A/D window. By double clicking the FFT

10 Hz, we obtain the FFT of V(1) as shown in Fig. 17.37(b). The FFT-generated graph contains the dc and harmonic components within theselected frequency range. Notice that the magnitudes and frequenciesof the harmonics agree with the DFT-generated tabulated values.c

Solution:
1.Deﬁne. Although the problem appears to be clearly stated, it
might be advisable to check with the individual who assigned
the problem to make sure he or she wants the transient responserather than the steady-state response; in the latter case theproblem becomes trivial.
2.Present. We are to determine the response i(t) given the input
using PSpice and Fourier analysis.
3.Alternative. We will use DFT to perform the initial analysis. We
will then check using the FFT approach.
4.Attempt. The schematic is shown in Fig. 17.39. We may use the
DFT approach to obtain the Fourier coefﬁcents of i(t). Since the
period of the input waveform is in the

Fig. 17.40(a). By double clicking the FFT icon and setting the
range of the X-axis from 0 to 200 Hz, we generate the FFT ofI(L1) shown in Fig. 17.40(b). It is clear from the FFT-generatedplot that only the dc component and the ﬁrst harmonic arevisible. Higher harmonics are negligibly small.
One ﬁnal observation, does the answer make sense? Let us
look at the actual transient response, 
The period of the cosine wave is
10 ms while the time constant of the exponential is 2000 ms(2 seconds). So, the answer we obtained by Fourier techniquesdoes agree.

We demonstrated in Section 17.4 that the Fourier series expansion per-
mits the application of the phasor techniques used in ac analysis to cir-
cuits containing nonsinusoidal periodic excitations. The Fourier serieshas many other practical applications, particularly in communicationsand signal processing. Typical applications include spectrum analysis,ﬁltering, rectiﬁcation, and harmonic distortion. We will consider twoof these: spectrum analyzers and ﬁlters.
17.8.1 Spectrum Analyzers
The Fourier series provides the spectrum of a signal. As we have seen,the spectrum consists of the amplitudes and phases of the harmonicsversus frequency. By providing the spectrum of a signal , theFourier series helps us identify the pertinent features of the signal. Itdemonstrates which frequencies are playing an important role in theshape of the output and which ones are not. For example, audiblesounds have signiﬁcant components in the frequency range of 20 Hzto 15 kHz, while visible light signals range from GHz to GHz.Table 17.4 presents some other signals and the frequency ranges of
their components. A periodic function is said to be band-limited if its
amplitude spectrum contains only a ﬁnite number of coefﬁcients or
In this case, the Fourier series becomes
(17.75)
This shows that we need only terms (namely, 
to completely specify if is known. This leads
to the sampling theorem: a band-limited periodic function whose
Fourier series contains N harmonics is uniquely speciﬁed by its values
at instants in one period.
Aspectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the amplitude
of the components of a signal versus frequency. It shows the variousfrequency components (spectral lines) that indicate the amount ofenergy at each frequency.
It is unlike an oscilloscope, which displays the entire signal (all
components) versus time. An oscilloscope shows the signal in the timedomain, while the spectrum analyzer shows the signal in the frequencydomain. There is perhaps no instrument more useful to a circuit ana-lyst than the spectrum analyzer. An analyzer can conduct noise and spu-rious signal analysis, phase checks, electromagnetic interference andﬁlter examinations, vibration measurements, radar measurements, andmore. Spectrum analyzers are commercially available in various sizesand shapes. Figure 17.42 displays a typical one.
17.8.2 Filters
Filters are an important component of electronics and communicationssystems. Chapter 14 presented a full discussion on passive and activeﬁlters. Here, we investigate how to design ﬁlters to select the funda-mental component (or any desired harmonic) of the input signal andreject other harmonics. This ﬁltering process cannot be accomplished2N/H110011/H9275

without the Fourier series expansion of the input signal. For the purpose
of illustration, we will consider two cases, a lowpass ﬁlter and a band-pass ﬁlter. In Example 17.6, we already looked at a highpass RLﬁlter.
The output of a lowpass ﬁlter depends on the input signal, the
transfer function of the ﬁlter, and the corner or half-power fre-quency We recall that for an RC passive ﬁlter. As shown
in Fig. 17.43(a), the lowpass ﬁlter passes the dc and low-frequency com-ponents, while blocking the high-frequency components. By making sufﬁciently large e.g., making Csmall), a large number of
the harmonics can be passed. On the other hand, by making sufﬁ-ciently small we can block out all the ac components and
pass only dc, as shown typically in Fig. 17.43(b). (See Fig. 17.2(a) forthe Fourier series expansion of the square wave.)

Similarly, the output of a bandpass ﬁlter depends on the input signal,
the transfer function of the ﬁlter , its bandwidth B, and its center
frequency As illustrated in Fig. 17.44(a), the ﬁlter passes all the har-
monics of the input signal within a band of frequencies centered around We have assumed that and are withinthat band. If the ﬁlter is made highly selective and where is the fundamental frequency of the input signal, the ﬁlterpasses only the fundamental component of the input and blocksout all higher harmonics. As shown in Fig. 17.44(b), with a square wave
as input, we obtain a sine wave of the same frequency as the output.

Summary
1. A periodic function is one that repeats itself every Tseconds; that
is, 
2. Any nonsinusoidal periodic function f(t) that we encounter in elec-
trical engineering can be expressed in terms of sinusoids using
Fourier series:
where is the fundamental frequency. The Fourier series
resolves the function into the dc component and an ac compo-
nent containing inﬁnitely many harmonically related sinusoids.The Fourier coefﬁcients are determined as
If f(t) is an even function, and when f(t) is odd, 
and If f(t) is half-wave symmetric, for
even values of n.

4. Fourier series representation allows us to apply the phasor method
in analyzing circuits when the source function is a nonsinusoidal
periodic function. We use phasor technique to determine theresponse of each harmonic in the series, transform the responsesto the time domain, and add them up.
5. The average-power of periodic voltage and current is 
In other words, the total average power is the sum of the averagepowers in each harmonically related voltage and current.
6. A periodic function can also be represented in terms of an expo-
nential (or complex) Fourier series as
where
and The exponential form describes the spectrum of
f(t) in terms of the amplitude and phase of ac components at pos-
itive and negative harmonic frequencies. Thus, there are three basicforms of Fourier series representation: the trigonometric form, theamplitude-phase form, and the exponential form.
7.The frequency (or line) spectrum is the plot of and or and
versus frequency. 
8. The rms value of a periodic function is given by
The power dissipated by a resistance is
This relationship is known as Parseval’ s theorem .
9. Using PSpice, a Fourier analysis of a circuit can be performed in
conjunction with the transient analysis.
10. Fourier series ﬁnd application in spectrum analyzers and ﬁlters.
The spectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the discrete
Fourier spectra of an input signal, so that an analyst can determinethe frequencies and relative energies of the signal’s components.Because the Fourier spectra are discrete spectra, ﬁlters can bedesigned for great effectiveness in blocking frequency componentsof a signal that are outside a desired range.P

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Career in Communications Systems
Communications systems apply the principles of circuit analysis. A
communication system is designed to convey information from asource (the transmitter) to a destination (the receiver) via a channel (thepropagation medium). Communications engineers design systems fortransmitting and receiving information. The information can be in theform of voice, data, or video.
We live in the information age—news, weather, sports, shopping,
financial, business inventory, and other sources make information avail-able to us almost instantly via communications systems. Some obvious
examples of communications systems are the telephone network,mobile cellular telephones, radio, cable TV , satellite TV , fax, and radar.Mobile radio, used by police and ﬁre departments, aircraft, and vari-ous businesses is another example.
The ﬁeld of communications is perhaps the fastest growing area in
electrical engineering. The merging of the communications ﬁeld withcomputer technology in recent years has led to digital data communica-tions networks such as local area networks, metropolitan area networks,and broadband integrated services digital networks. For example, theInternet (the “information superhighway”) allows educators, businesspeople, and others to send electronic mail from their computers world-wide, log onto remote databases, and transfer ﬁles. The Internet has hitthe world like a tidal wave and is drastically changing the way people dobusiness, communicate, and get information. This trend will continue.
Acommunications engineer designs systems that provide high-
quality information services. The systems include hardware for generating,transmitting, and receiving information signals. Communications engineersare employed in numerous communications industries and places wherecommunications systems are routinely used. More and more governmentagencies, academic departments, and businesses are demanding faster andmore accurate transmission of information. To meet these needs, commu-nications engineers are in high demand. Therefore, the future is in com-munications and every electrical engineer must prepare accordingly.

Fourier series enable us to represent a periodic function as a sum of
sinusoids and to obtain the frequency spectrum from the series. TheFourier transform allows us to extend the concept of a frequency spec-trum to nonperiodic functions. The transform assumes that a nonperi-odic function is a periodic function with an inﬁnite period. Thus, theFourier transform is an integral representation of a nonperiodic func-tion that is analogous to a Fourier series representation of a periodicfunction.
The Fourier transform is an integral transform like the Laplace
transform. It transforms a function in the time domain into the fre-quency domain. The Fourier transform is very useful in communica-tions systems and digital signal processing, in situations where theLaplace transform does not apply. While the Laplace transform canonly handle circuits with inputs for with initial conditions, theFourier transform can handle circuits with inputs for as well asthose for 
We begin by using a Fourier series as a stepping stone in deﬁning
the Fourier transform. Then we develop some of the properties of theFourier transform. Next, we apply the Fourier transform in analyzingcircuits. We discuss Parseval’s theorem, compare the Laplace andFourier transforms, and see how the Fourier transform is applied inamplitude modulation and sampling.
Deﬁnition of the Fourier Transform
We saw in the previous chapter that a nonsinusoidal periodic function
can be represented by a Fourier series, provided that it satisﬁes theDirichlet conditions. What happens if a function is not periodic? Unfor-tunately, there are many important nonperiodic functions—such as aunit step or an exponential function—that we cannot represent by aFourier series. As we shall see, the Fourier transform allows a trans-formation from the time to the frequency domain, even if the functionis not periodic.
Suppose we want to ﬁnd the Fourier transform of a nonperiodic
function p(t), shown in Fig. 18.1(a). We consider a periodic function
f(t) whose shape over one period is the same as p(t), as shown in
Fig. 18.1(b). If we let the period only a single pulse of width
[the desired nonperiodic function in Fig. 18.1(a)] remains, because
the adjacent pulses have been moved to inﬁnity. Thus, the functionf(t) is no longer periodic. In other words, as It is
interesting to consider the spectrum of f (t) for and 
(see Section 17.6). Figure 18.2 shows the effect of increasing T
on the spectrum. First, we notice that the general shape of thespectrum remains the same, and the frequency at which the envelopeﬁrst becomes zero remains the same. However, the amplitude of thespectrum and the spacing between adjacent components bothdecrease, while the number of harmonics increases. Thus, over arange of frequencies, the sum of the amplitudes of the harmonicsremains almost constant. As the total “strength” or energy of thet/H110050.2 A/H1100510TS/H11009. f

becomes continuous.

domain to the frequency domain.Substituting Eq. (18.2) into Eq. (18.1) gives

Properties of the Fourier Transform
We now develop some properties of the Fourier transform that are use-
ful in ﬁnding the transforms of complicated functions from the trans-
forms of simple functions. For each property, we will ﬁrst state andderive it, and then illustrate it with some examples.
Linearity
If and are the Fourier transforms of and respec-tively, then
(18.12)
where and are constants. This property simply states that theFourier transform of a linear combination of functions is the same asthe linear combination of the transforms of the individual functions.The proof of the linearity property in Eq. (18.12) is straightforward.By deﬁnition,

For example, Using the linearity
property,

compression ( ) implies frequency expansion. The proof of the
time-scaling property proceeds as follows.
(18.16)
If we let so that then
(18.17)
For example, for the rectangular pulse p(t) in Example 18.2,
(18.18a)
Using Eq. (18.15),
(18.18b)
It may be helpful to plot p(t) and and their Fourier transforms.
Since
(18.19a)
then replacing every t with gives
(18.19b)
showing that is time compressed, as shown in Fig. 18.9(b). Toplot both Fourier transforms in Eq. (18.18), we recall that the sincfunction has zeros when its argument is where nis an integer.
Hence, for the transform of p(t) in Eq. (18.18a), 
and for the transform of in Eq. (18.18b), 
The plots of the Fourier transforms are
shown in Fig. 18.9, which shows that time compression correspondswith frequency expansion. We should expect this intuitively, becausewhen the signal is squashed in time, we expect it to change morerapidly, thereby causing higher-frequency components to exist.
Time Shifting
If then
(18.20)
that is, a delay in the time domain corresponds to a phase shift in thefrequency domain. To derive the time shifting property, we note that

Taking the Fourier transforms of the ﬁrst and last terms, we obtain
(18.33)
which agrees with the result in Example 18.3.
Time Integration
Given that then
(18.34)
that is, the transform of the integral of f (t) is obtained by dividing the
transform of f (t) by and adding the result to the impulse term that
reﬂects the dc component Someone might ask, “How do we know
that when we take the Fourier transform for time integration, we shouldintegrate over the interval and not ?” When we inte-grate over the result does not depend on time anymore, andthe Fourier transform of a constant is what we will eventually get. Butwhen we integrate over we get the integral of the functionfrom the past to time t, so that the result depends on tand we can take
the Fourier transform of that.
If is replaced by 0 in Eq. (18.8),
(18.35)
indicating that the dc component is zero when the integral of f(t) over
all time vanishes. The proof of the time integration in Eq. (18.34) willbe given later when we consider the convolution property.
For example, we know that and that integrating the
impulse function gives the unit step function [see Eq. (7.39a)]. Byapplying the property in Eq. (18.34), we obtain the Fourier transformof the unit step function as

The important relationship in Eq. (18.46)
is the key reason for using the Fouriertransform in the analysis of linearsystems.If and are the Fourier transforms of and

To derive the convolution property, we take the Fourier transform
of both sides of Eq. (18.43) to get

as expected. This result expands the phasor method beyond what wasdone with the Fourier series in the previous chapter.
To illustrate the convolution property, suppose both h(t) and
x(t)are identical rectangular pulses, as shown in Fig. 18.12(a) and
18.12(b). We recall from Example 18.2 and Fig. 18.5 that the Fouriertransforms of the rectangular pulses are sinc functions, as shown inFig. 18.12(c) and 18.12(d). According to the convolution property,the product of the sinc functions should give us the convolution ofthe rectangular pulses in the time domain. Thus, the convolutionof the pulses in Fig. 18.12(e) and the product of the sinc functionsin Fig. 18.12(f) form a Fourier pair.
In view of the duality property, we expect that if convolution in
the time domain corresponds with multiplication in the frequency /H11005

which is convolution in the frequency domain. The proof of Eq. (18.48)
readily follows from the duality property in Eq. (18.38).
Let us now derive the time integration property in Eq. (18.34). If
we replace x(t) with the unit step function and h(t) with f(t) in
Eq. (18.43), then
(18.49)
But by the deﬁnition of the unit step function,
We can write this as
Substituting this into Eq. (18.49) makes the interval of integration
change from to and thus Eq. (18.49) becomes
Taking the Fourier transform of both sides yields
(18.50)
But from Eq. (18.36), the Fourier transform of the unit step function is
Substituting this into Eq. (18.50) gives
(18.51)
which is the time integration property of Eq. (18.34). Note that in
Eq. (18.51), since is only nonzero at

Find the Fourier transforms of the following functions: (a) signum
function sgn shown in Fig. 18.13, (b) the double-sided exponential
and (c) the sinc function 
Solution:
(a) We can obtain the Fourier transform of the signum function in three
ways.
■METHOD 1 We can write the signum function in terms of the unit
step function as
But from Eq. (18.36),
Applying this and the reversal property, we obtain

Circuit Applications
The Fourier transform generalizes the phasor technique to nonperiodic
functions. Therefore, we apply Fourier transforms to circuits with non-sinusoidal excitations in exactly the same way we apply phasor techniquesto circuits with sinusoidal excitations. Thus, Ohm’s law is still valid:
(18.52)
where and are the Fourier transforms of the voltage and cur-rent and is the impedance. We get the same expressions for theimpedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors as in phasor analy-sis, namely,
(18.53)
Once we transform the functions for the circuit elements into the fre-quency domain and take the Fourier transforms of the excitations, wecan use circuit techniques such as voltage division, source transforma-tion, mesh analysis, node analysis, or Thevenin’s theorem, to ﬁnd theunknown response (current or voltage). Finally, we take the inverseFourier transform to obtain the response in the time domain.
Although the Fourier transform method produces a response that
exists for Fourier analysis cannot handle circuits withinitial conditions.
The transfer function is again deﬁned as the ratio of the output
response to the input excitation ; that is,

In fact, F()2is sometimes known as
the energy spectral density of signal f(t).0/H92750Parseval’s Theorem
Parseval’s theorem demonstrates one practical use of the Fourier trans-
form. It relates the energy carried by a signal to the Fourier transform ofthe signal. If p (t) is the power associated with the signal, the energy car-
ried by the signal is

In order to be able to compare the energy content of current and volt-age signals, it is convenient to use a resistor as the base for energycalculation. For a resistor, where f (t)
stands for either voltage or current. The energy delivered to the resistor is

Parseval’s theorem relates energy associated with a signal to its Fourier
transform. It provides the physical signiﬁcance of namely, that
is a measure of the energy density (in joules per hertz) corre-

To derive Eq. (18.59), we begin with Eq. (18.58) and substitute
Eq. (18.9) for one of the f(t)’s. We obtain

The voltage across a 10- resistor is V . Find the total
energy dissipated in the resistor.
Solution:
1.Deﬁne. The problem is well deﬁned and clearly stated.
2.Present. We are given the voltage across the resistor for all time
and are asked to ﬁnd the energy dissipated by the resistor. We note
that the voltage is zero for all time less than zero. Thus, we onlyneed to consider the time from zero to inﬁnity.
3.Alternative. There are basically two ways to ﬁnd this answer.
The ﬁrst would be to ﬁnd the answer in the time domain. Wewill use the second approach to ﬁnd the answer using Fourieranalysis.

Comparing the Fourier and 
Laplace Transforms
It is worthwhile to take some moments to compare the Laplace and
Fourier transforms. The following similarities and differences shouldbe noted:
1. The Laplace transform deﬁned in Chapter 15 is one-sided in that
the integral is over making it only useful for positive-
time functions, f(t), The Fourier transform is applicable to
functions deﬁned for all time.
2.For a function f (t) that is nonzero for positive time only (i.e.,
) and the two transforms are
related by
(18.66)
This equation also shows that the Fourier transform can beregarded as a special case of the Laplace transform with Recall that Therefore, Eq. (18.66) shows that the
Laplace transform is related to the entire s plane, whereas the
Fourier transform is restricted to the axis. See Fig. 15.1.
3. The Laplace transform is applicable to a wider range of functions
than the Fourier transform. For example, the function tu(t) has a
Laplace transform but no Fourier transform. But Fourier trans-forms exist for signals that are not physically realizable and haveno Laplace transforms.
4. The Laplace transform is better suited for the analysis of transient
problems involving initial conditions, since it permits the inclusionof the initial conditions, whereas the Fourier transform does not.The Fourier transform is especially useful for problems in thesteady state.
5. The Fourier transform provides greater insight into the frequency
characteristics of signals than does the Laplace transform.
Some of the similarities and differences can be observed by compar-ing Tables 15.1 and 15.2 with Tables 18.1 and 18.2.j/H9275s/H11005s/H11001j/H9275.s/H11005j/H9275.F(/H9275) /H11005F(s) 0

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a process whereby the amplitude of
the carrier is controlled by the modulating signal.Applications
Besides its usefulness for circuit analysis, the Fourier transform is used
extensively in a variety of ﬁelds such as optics, spectroscopy, acoustics,computer science, and electrical engineering. In electrical engineering,it is applied in communications systems and signal processing, wherefrequency response and frequency spectra are vital. Here we considertwo simple applications: amplitude modulation (AM) and sampling.
18.7.1 Amplitude Modulation
Electromagnetic radiation or transmission of information throughspace has become an indispensable part of a modern technologicalsociety. However, transmission through space is only efﬁcient andeconomical at high frequencies (above 20 kHz). To transmit intelli-gent signals—such as for speech and music—contained in the low-frequency range of 50 Hz to 20 kHz is expensive; it requires a hugeamount of power and large antennas. A common method of trans-mitting low-frequency audio information is to transmit a high-frequencysignal, called a carrier, which is controlled in some way to corre-spond to the audio information. Three characteristics (amplitude, fre-quency, or phase) of a carrier can be controlled so as to allow it tocarry the intelligent signal, called the modulating signal . Here we will
only consider the control of the carrier’s amplitude. This is known asamplitude modulation.18.7836 Chapter 18 Fourier Transform
AM is used in ordinary commercial radio bands and the video portion
of commercial television.
Suppose the audio information, such as voice or music (or the
modulating signal in general) to be transmitted is while the high-frequency carrier is where Then an AM signal f(t) is given by
(18.67)
Figure 18.22 illustrates the modulating signal the carrier andthe AM signal f(t). We can use the result in Eq. (18.27) together with the
Fourier transform of the cosine function (see Example 18.1 or Table 18.1)to determine the spectrum of the AM signal:
(18.68)
where is the Fourier transform of the modulating signal Shown in Fig. 18.23 is the frequency spectrum of the AM signal. Fig-ure 18.23 indicates that the AM signal consists of the carrier and twoother sinusoids.

Notice that we have assumed that the modulating signal is sinu-
soidal to make the analysis easy. In real life, m(t) is a nonsinusoidal,
band-limited signal—its frequency spectrum is within the range
between 0 and (i.e., the signal has an upper frequencylimit). Typically, for AM radio. If the frequency spectrumof the modulating signal is as shown in Fig. 18.24(a), then the fre-quency spectrum of the AM signal is shown in Fig. 18.24(b). Thus,to avoid any interference, carriers for AM radio stations are spaced10 kHz apart.
At the receiving end of the transmission, the audio informa-
tion is recovered from the modulated carrier by a process known asdemodulation.f

18.7.2 Sampling
In analog systems, signals are processed in their entirety. However, in
modern digital systems, only samples of signals are required for pro-cessing. This is possible as a result of the sampling theorem given inSection 17.8.1. The sampling can be done by using a train of pulses orimpulses. We will use impulse sampling here.
Consider the continuous signal shown in Fig. 18.25(a). This
can be multiplied by a train of impulses shown inFig. 18.25(b), where is the sampling interval and is the
sampling frequency or the sampling rate. The sampled signal is

Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Never trouble another for what you can do yourself.Never spend your money before you have it.Never buy what you do not want because it is cheap.Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst, and cold.We seldom repent having eaten too little.
Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly.How much pain the evils have cost us that have never happened!Take things always by the smooth handle.
When angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, a hundred.

While two thirds of all engineers work in private industry, some work
in academia and prepare students for engineering careers. The courseon circuit analysis you are studying is an important part of the prepa-ration process. If you enjoy teaching others, you may want to considerbecoming an engineering educator.
Engineering professors work on state-of-the-art research projects,
teach courses at graduate and undergraduate levels, and provide servicesto their professional societies and the community at large. They areexpected to make original contributions in their areas of specialty. Thisrequires a broad-based education in the fundamentals of electrical engi-neering and a mastery of the skills necessary for communicating theirefforts to others.
If you like to do research, to work at the frontiers of engineering, to
make contributions to technological advancement, to invent, consult, and/or teach, consider a career in engineering education. The best way to startis by talking with your professors and beneﬁting from their experience.
Asolid understanding of mathematics and physics at the under-
graduate level is vital to your success as an engineering professor. Ifyou are having difﬁculty in solving your engineering textbook prob-lems, start correcting any weaknesses you have in your mathematicsand physics fundamentals.
Most universities these days require that engineering professors have
a doctor’s degree. In addition, some universities require that they beactively involved in research leading to publications in reputable journals.

A two-port network is an electrical network with two separate ports
for input and output.
Thus, a two-port network has two terminal pairs acting as access points.
As shown in Fig. 19.1(b), the current entering one terminal of a pairleaves the other terminal in the pair. Three-terminal devices such astransistors can be conﬁgured into two-port networks.
Our study of two-port networks is for at least two reasons. First,
such networks are useful in communications, control systems, powersystems, and electronics. For example, they are used in electronics tomodel transistors and to facilitate cascaded design. Second, knowingthe parameters of a two-port network enables us to treat it as a “blackbox” when embedded within a larger network.
To characterize a two-port network requires that we relate the ter-
minal quantities , and in Fig. 19.1(b), out of which two areindependent. The various terms that relate these voltages and currentsare called parameters .Our goal in this chapter is to derive six sets of these
parameters. We will show the relationship between these parameters andhow two-port networks can be connected in series, parallel, or cascade.As with op amps, we are only interested in the terminal behavior of thecircuits. And we will assume that the two-port circuits contain no inde-pendent sources, although they can contain dependent sources. Finally,we will apply some of the concepts developed in this chapter to theanalysis of transistor circuits and synthesis of ladder networks.
Impedance Parameters
Impedance and admittance parameters are commonly used in the syn-thesis of ﬁlters. They are also useful in the design and analysis ofimpedance-matching networks and power distribution networks. We19.2I2 V1, V2, I1To prepare yourself for a career in engineering education, get as broad
an education as possible, because electrical engineering is changing rap-
idly and becoming interdisciplinary. Without doubt, engineering educa-tion is a rewarding career. Professors get a sense of satisfaction andfulﬁllment as they see their students graduate, become leaders in theirprofession, and contribute signiﬁcantly to the betterment of humanity.
Introduction
Apair of terminals through which a current may enter or leave a net-
work is known as a port. Two-terminal devices or elements (such as
resistors, capacitors, and inductors) result in one-port networks. Mostof the circuits we have dealt with so far are two-terminal or one-portcircuits, represented in Fig. 19.1(a). We have considered the voltageacross or current through a single pair of terminals—such as the twoterminals of a resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor. We have also stud-ied four-terminal or two-port circuits involving op amps, transistors,and transformers, as shown in Fig. 19.1(b). In general, a network mayhave nports. A port is an access to the network and consists of a pair
of terminals; the current entering one terminal leaves through the otherterminal so that the net current entering the port equals zero.
In this chapter, we are mainly concerned with two-port networks
(or, simply, two-ports).19.1850 Chapter 19 Two-Port Networks

Atwo-port network may be voltage-driven as in Fig. 19.2(a) or
current-driven as in Fig. 19.2(b). From either Fig. 19.2(a) or (b), theterminal voltages can be related to the terminal currents as
(19.1)
or in matrix form as
(19.2)
where the terms are called the impedance parameters, or simply zparameters, and have units of ohms.
The values of the parameters can be evaluated by setting 
(input port open-circuited) or (output port open-circuited). Thus,
(19.3)
Since the z parameters are obtained by open-circuiting the input or out-

(19.6)
The above procedure provides us with a means of calculating or mea-suring the z parameters.
Sometimes and are called driving-point impedances, while
and are called transfer impedances. A driving-point impedance
is the input impedance of a two-terminal (one-port) device. Thus, is the input driving-point impedance with the output port open-circuited, while is the output driving-point impedance with the inputport open-circuited.
When , the two-port network is said to be symmetrical.
This implies that the network has mirrorlike symmetry about some cen-ter line; that is, a line can be found that divides the network into twosimilar halves.
When the two-port network is linear and has no dependent sources,
the transfer impedances are equal ( ), and the two-port is saidto be reciprocal. This means that if the points of excitation and response
are interchanged, the transfer impedances remain the same. As illus-trated in Fig. 19.4, a two-port is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal volt-age source at one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port gives thesame ammeter reading. The reciprocal network yields accord-ing to Eq. (19.1) when connected as in Fig. 19.4(a), but yields when connected as in Fig. 19.4(b). This is possible only if .Any two-port that is made entirely of resistors, capacitors, and induc-tors must be reciprocal. A reciprocal network can be replaced by theT-equivalent circuit in Fig. 19.5(a). If the network is not reciprocal, a
more general equivalent network is shown in Fig. 19.5(b); notice thatthis ﬁgure follows directly from Eq. (19.1).z

Admittance Parameters
In the previous section we saw that impedance parameters may not
exist for a two-port network. So there is a need for an alternative meansof describing such a network. This need may be met by the second setof parameters, which we obtain by expressing the terminal currents interms of the terminal voltages. In either Fig. 19.12(a) or (b), the ter-minal currents can be expressed in terms of the terminal voltages as
(19.8)
or in matrix form as
(19.9)
The terms are known as the admittance parameters (or, simply, y
parameters) and have units of siemens.
The values of the parameters can be determined by setting 
(input port short-circuited) or (output port short-circuited). Thus,
(19.10)
Since the y parameters are obtained by short-circuiting the input or out-
put port, they are also called the short-circuit admittance parameters.
Speciﬁcally,
(19.11)
Following Eq. (19.10), we obtain and by connecting a cur-
rent to port 1 and short-circuiting port 2 as in Fig. 19.12(a), ﬁnding
and , and then calculating
(19.12)
Similarly, we obtain and by connecting a current source toport 2 and short-circuiting port 1 as in Fig. 19.12(b), ﬁnding and and then getting
(19.13)
This procedure provides us with a means of calculating or measuringthe yparameters. The impedance and admittance parameters are col-
lectively referred to as immittance parameters.y

or in matrix form,
(19.15)
The terms are known as the hybrid parameters (or, simply, h
parameters) because they are a hybrid combination of ratios. They
are very useful for describing electronic devices such as transistors(see Section 19.9); it is much easier to measure experimentally the h
parameters of such devices than to measure their zor yparameters.
In fact, we have seen that the ideal transformer in Fig. 19.6, describedby Eq. (19.7), does not have zparameters. The ideal transformer can
be described by the hybrid parameters, because Eq. (19.7) conformswith Eq. (19.14).
The values of the parameters are determined as
(19.16)
It is evident from Eq. (19.16) that the parameters , and represent an impedance, a voltage gain, a current gain, and an admit-tance, respectively. This is why they are called the hybrid parameters.To be speciﬁc,
(19.17)
The procedure for calculating the hparameters is similar to that used
for the z or yparameters. We apply a voltage or current source to the
appropriate port, short-circuit or open-circuit the other port, dependingon the parameter of interest, and perform regular circuit analysis. Forreciprocal networks, . This can be proved in the same wayas we proved that . Figure 19.20 shows the hybrid model ofa two-port network.
Aset of parameters closely related to the hparameters are the g
parameters or inverse hybrid parameters. These are used to describe
the terminal currents and voltages as

Equations (19.22) and (19.23) relate the input variables ( and ) tothe output variables ( and ). Notice that in computing the trans-mission parameters, is used rather than , because the current isconsidered to be leaving the network, as shown in Fig. 19.31, asopposed to entering the network as in Fig. 19.1(b). This is done merelyfor conventional reasons; when you cascade two-ports (output to input),it is most logical to think of as leaving the two-port. It is also cus-tomary in the power industry to consider as leaving the two-port.
The two-port parameters in Eqs. (19.22) and (19.23) provide a
measure of how a circuit transmits voltage and current from a sourceto a load. They are useful in the analysis of transmission lines (suchas cable and ﬁber) because they express sending-end variables ( and
) in terms of the receiving-end variables ( and ). For this rea-
son, they are called transmission parameters . They are also known as
ABCD parameters. They are used in the design of telephone systems,
microwave networks, and radars.
The transmission parameters are determined as

Thus, the transmission parameters are called, speciﬁcally,

the transmission parameters provide a direct relationship between inputand output variables, they are very useful in cascaded networks.

Relationships Between Parameters
Since the six sets of parameters relate the same input and output ter-
minal variables of the same two-port network, they should be interre-lated. If two sets of parameters exist, we can relate one set to the otherset. Let us demonstrate the process with two examples.
Given the z parameters, let us obtain the y parameters. From
Eq. (19.2),
(19.31)
or
(19.32)
Also, from Eq. (19.9),
(19.33)
Comparing Eqs. (19.32) and (19.33), we see that
(19.34)
The adjoint of the matrix is
and its determinant is
Substituting these into Eq. (19.34), we get
(19.35)
Equating terms yields
(19.36)
As a second example, let us determine the hparameters from the
zparameters. From Eq. (19.1),

Interconnection of Networks
Alarge, complex network may be divided into subnetworks for the pur-
poses of analysis and design. The subnetworks are modeled as two-
port networks, interconnected to form the original network. Thetwo-port networks may therefore be regarded as building blocks thatcan be interconnected to form a complex network. The interconnectioncan be in series, in parallel, or in cascade. Although the interconnectednetwork can be described by any of the six parameter sets, a certainset of parameters may have a deﬁnite advantage. For example, whenthe networks are in series, their individual zparameters add up to give
the zparameters of the larger network. When they are in parallel, their
individual yparameters add up to give the y parameters of the larger
network. When they are cascaded, their individual transmission param-eters can be multiplied together to get the transmission parameters ofthe larger network.19.7Find the zparameters of the op amp circuit in Fig. 19.38. Show that
the circuit has no y parameters.

Series connection of two two-port
networks.Consider the series connection of two two-port networks shown in
Fig. 19.39. The networks are regarded as being in series because their
input currents are the same and their voltages add. In addition, eachnetwork has a common reference, and when the circuits are placed inseries, the common reference points of each circuit are connectedtogether. For network 
(19.44)
and for network 
(19.45)
We notice from Fig. 19.39 that
(19.46)
and that
(19.47)
Thus, the z parameters for the overall network are
(19.48)
or
(19.49)
showing that the z parameters for the overall network are the sum of
the zparameters for the individual networks. This can be extended to
nnetworks in series. If two two-port networks in the model, for
example, are connected in series, we use Table 19.1 to convert the to and then apply Eq. (19.49). We ﬁnally convert the result back to
using Table 19.1.
Two two-port networks are in parallel when their port voltages are
equal and the port currents of the larger network are the sums of theindividual port currents. In addition, each circuit must have a commonreference and when the networks are connected together, they must allhave their common references tied together. The parallel connection oftwo two-port networks is shown in Fig. 19.40. For the two networks,

Substituting Eqs. (19.50) and (19.51) into Eq. (19.52b) yields
(19.53)
Thus, the y parameters for the overall network are
(19.54)
or
(19.55)
showing that the y parameters of the overall network are the sum of
the yparameters of the individual networks. The result can be extended
to ntwo-port networks in parallel.
Two networks are said to be cascaded when the output of one is
the input of the other. The connection of two two-port networks in cas-
cade is shown in Fig. 19.41. For the two networks,

Thus, the transmission parameters for the overall network are the product
of the transmission parameters for the individual transmission parameters:

Computing Two-Por t Parameters
Using PSpice
Hand calculation of the two-port parameters may become difﬁcult
when the two-port is complicated. We resort to PSpice in such situa-
tions. If the circuit is purely resistive, PSpice dc analysis may be used;
otherwise, PSpice ac analysis is required at a speciﬁc frequency. The
key to using PSpice in computing a particular two-port parameter is to
remember how that parameter is deﬁned and to constrain the appro-priate port variable with a 1-A or 1-V source while using an open orshort circuit to impose the other necessary constraints. The followingtwo examples illustrate the idea.19.8

circuited and PSpice will not allow such. We may include the

Applications
We have seen how the six sets of network parameters can be used to
characterize a wide range of two-port networks. Depending on the waytwo-ports are interconnected to form a larger network, a particularset of parameters may have advantages over others, as we noticed inSection 19.7. In this section, we will consider two important applicationareas of two-port parameters: transistor circuits and synthesis of laddernetworks.
19.9.1 Transistor Circuits
The two-port network is often used to isolate a load from the excita-tion of a circuit. For example, the two-port in Fig. 19.55 may repre-sent an ampliﬁer, a ﬁlter, or some other network. When the two-portrepresents an ampliﬁer, expressions for the voltage gain the currentgain the input impedance and the output impedance can bederived with ease. They are deﬁned as follows:
(19.62)
(19.63)(19.64)(19.65)
Any of the six sets of two-port parameters can be used to derive the
expressions in Eqs. (19.62) to (19.65). However, the hybrid ( h) param-
eters are the most useful for transistors; they are easily measured andare often provided in the manufacturer’s data or spec sheets for tran-sistors. The hparameters provide a quick estimate of the performance
of transistor circuits. They are used for ﬁnding the exact voltage gain,input impedance, and output impedance of a transistor. Z

Common emitter ampliﬁer: (a) circuit schematic, (b) hybrid model.The hparameters for transistors have speciﬁc meanings expressed
by their subscripts. They are listed by the ﬁrst subscript and related to
the general h parameters as follows:
(19.66)
The subscripts i , r, f, and o stand for input, reverse, forward, and output.
The second subscript speciﬁes the type of connection used: efor com-
mon emitter (CE), c for common collector (CC), and b for common base
(CB). Here we are mainly concerned with the common-emitter connec-tion. Thus, the four hparameters for the common-emitter ampliﬁer are:
(19.67)
These are calculated or measured in the same way as the general hparameters. Typical values are 
We must keep in mind that these values represent ac
characteristics of the transistor, measured under speciﬁc circumstances.

ampliﬁer and the equivalent hybrid model. From the ﬁgure, we see that

Solution:
1.Deﬁne. In an initial look at this problem, it appears to be clearly
stated. However, when we are asked to determine the inputimpedance and the voltage gain, do they refer to the transistor orthe circuit? As far as the current gain and the output impedanceare concerned, they are the same for both cases.
We ask for clariﬁcation and are told that we should calculate

3.Alternative. There are a couple of ways we can approach the
problem, the most straightforward being to use the equivalentcircuit shown in Fig. 19.57. Once you have the equivalent circuityou can use circuit analysis to determine the answer. Once youhave a solution, you can check it by plugging in the answer intothe circuit equations to see if they are correct. Another approachis to simplify the right-hand side of the equivalent circuit andwork backward to see if you obtain approximately the sameanswer. We will use that approach here.

Another application of two-port parameters is the synthesis (or build-ing) of ladder networks, which are found frequently in practice andale29559_ch19.qxd  07/16/2008  05:49 PM  Page 885

have particular use in designing passive lowpass ﬁlters. Based on our
discussion of second-order circuits in Chapter 8, the order of the ﬁl-ter is the order of the characteristic equation describing the ﬁlter andis determined by the number of reactive elements that cannot be com-bined into single elements (e.g., through series or parallel combina-tion). Figure 19.61(a) shows an LC ladder network with an odd
number of elements (to realize an odd-order ﬁlter), while Fig. 19.61(b)shows one with an even number of elements (for realizing an even-order ﬁlter). When either network is terminated by the load impedance
and the source impedance we obtain the structure in Fig. 19.62.
To make the design less complicated, we will assume that Our
goal is to synthesize the transfer function of the LC ladder network.
We begin by characterizing the ladder network by its admittance
parameters, namely,

The main objective in ﬁlter design is to select capacitors and inductorsso that the parameters and are synthesized, thereby realizing thedesired transfer function. To achieve this, we take advantage of an impor-tant property of the LC ladder network: all z and yparameters are ratios
of polynomials that contain only even powers of sor odd powers y

Summary
1. A two-port network is one with two ports (or two pairs of access
terminals), known as input and output ports.
2.The six parameters used to model a two-port network are the
impedance admittance hybrid inverse hybrid transmission and inverse transmission parameters.
3. The parameters relate the input and output port variables as 
4. The parameters can be calculated or measured by short-circuiting
or open-circuiting the appropriate input or output port.
5. A two-port network is reciprocal if 
or Networks that have dependent
sources are not reciprocal.
6. Table 19.1 provides the relationships between the six sets of
parameters. Three important relationships are
7. Two-port networks may be connected in series, in parallel, or in
cascade. In the series connection the z parameters are added, in the
parallel connection the y parameters are added, and in the cascade
connection the transmission parameters are multiplied in the cor-
rect order.
8. One can use PSpice to compute the two-port parameters by con-
straining the appropriate port variables with a 1-A or 1-V sourcewhile using an open or short circuit to impose the other necessaryconstraints.
9. The network parameters are speciﬁcally applied in the analysis of
transistor circuits and the synthesis of ladder LC networks. Net-
work parameters are especially useful in the analysis of transistorcircuits because these circuits are easily modeled as two-port net-works. LCladder networks, important in the design of passive low-
pass ﬁlters, resemble cascaded T networks and are therefore bestanalyzed as two-ports.[y]/H11005[z]

Simultaneous Equations 
and Matrix Inversion
In circuit analysis, we often encounter a set of simultaneous equations
having the form
(A.1)
where there are n unknown to be determined. Equation
(A.1) can be written in matrix form as
(A.2)
This matrix equation can be put in a compact form as
(A.3)
where
(A.4)
Ais a square ( ) matrix while X and Bare column matrices.
There are several methods for solving Eq. (A.1) or (A.3). These
include substitution, Gaussian elimination, Cramer’s rule, matrix inver-sion, and numerical analysis.
Cramer’s Rule
In many cases, Cramer’s rule can be used to solve the simultaneous equa-tions we encounter in circuit analysis. Cramer’s rule states that the solutionto Eq. (A.1) or (A.3) is

Notice that is the determinant of matrix A and is the determi-
nant of the matrix formed by replacing the kth column of A by B. It
is evident from Eq. (A.5) that Cramer’s rule applies only when 
When , the set of equations has no unique solution, because theequations are linearly dependent.
The value of the determinant , for example, can be obtained by
expanding along the ﬁrst row:

where the minor M

the matrix formed by striking out the ith row and jth column. The
value of may also be obtained by expanding along the firstcolumn:

Complex Numbers
The ability to manipulate complex numbers is very handy in circuit
analysis and in electrical engineering in general. Complex numbers areparticularly useful in the analysis of ac circuits. Again, although cal-culators and computer software packages are now available to manip-ulate complex numbers, it is still advisable for a student to be familiarwith how to handle them by hand.

Numbers
Acomplex number zmay be written in r ectangular form as

where xis the r eal part of zwhile yis the imaginary part
of z; that is,

Fig. B.1. Since ,

Asecond way of representing the complex number z is by speci-
fying its magnitude rand the angle it makes with the real axis, as
Fig. B.1 shows. This is known as the polar form. It is given by

Euler’s Formula
Euler’s formula is an important result in complex variables. We derive
it from the series expansion of , and . We know that
(B.19)
Replacing xby gives
(B.20)
Also,
(B.21)
so that
(B.22)
Comparing Eqs. (B.20) and (B.22), we conclude that
(B.23)
This is known as Euler’ s formula. The exponential form of represent-
ing a complex number as in Eq. (B.8) is based on Euler’s formula.From Eq. (B.23), notice that
(B.24)
and that
Replacing by in Eq. (B.23) gives
(B.25)
Adding Eqs. (B.23) and (B.25) yields

Appendix D
PSpice for Windows
There are several computer software packages, such as Spice , Mathcad,
Quattro , MATLAB , and Maple, which can be used for circuit analysis. The
most popular is Spice, which stands for Simulation Program with
Integrated-Circuit Emphasis. Spice was developed at the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California at
Berkeley in the 1970s for mainframe computers. Since then about 20 ver-sions have been developed. PSpice, a version of Spice for personal com-
puters, was developed by MicroSim Corporation in California and madeavailable in 1984 and later by OrCAD and cadence. PSpice has been made
available in different operating systems (DOS, Windows, Unix, etc.).
If you do not have access to PSpice, you can ﬁnd out how to obtain
a free student copy by going to the text website (www.mhhe.com/alexander). The instructions and examples in this appendix were devel-oped for version 9.1, but also work for later versions.
Assuming that you are using Windows and have the PSpice software
installed in your computer, you can access PSpice by clicking the Start
icon on the left-hand corner of your PC; drag the cursor to Programs, toPSpice students and to Schematics, and then click as shown in Fig. D.1.
The objective of this appendix is to provide a short tutorial on
using the Windows-based PSpice on an IBM PC or equivalent.
PSpice can analyze up to roughly 130 elements and 100 nodes. It
is capable of performing three major types of circuit analysis: dc analy-sis, transient analysis, and ac analysis. In addition, it can also performtransfer function analysis, Fourier analysis, and operating point analy-sis.The circuit can contain resistors, inductors, capacitors, independentand dependent voltage and current sources, op amps, transformers,transmission lines, and semiconductor devices.
We will assume that you are familiar with using the Microsoft
Windows operating system and that PSpice for Windows is already
installed in your computer. As with any standard Windows application,PSpice provides an on-line help system.
A-21
The student version of PSpice can be
obtained free of charge.
If you need help on any topic at any level, click Help, click Help Topics,
click Search, and type in the topic.
Design Center for Windows
In earlier versions of PSpice prior to Windows 95, PSpice for Windows
is formally known as the MicroSim Design Center , which is a com-
puter environment for simulating electric circuits. The Design Center
for Windows includes the following programs:
Schematics: This program is a graphical editor used to draw the
circuit to be simulated on the screen. It allows the user to enterD.1ale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-21

the components, wire the components together to form the cir-
cuit, and specify the type of analysis to be performed.
Pspice: This program simulates the circuit created using Schemat-
ics. By simulation, we mean a method of analysis described in
a program by which a circuit is represented by mathematicalmodels of the components comprising the circuit. 
Orcad PSpice: This program provides a graphic display of the out-
put generated by the PSpice program. It can be used to observe
any voltage or current in the circuit.
One may think of Schematics as the computer breadboard for setting
up the circuit topology, PSpice as the simulator (performing the compu-
tation), and Orcad PSpice as the oscilloscope. Using the Schematics pro-
gram is perhaps the hardest part of circuit simulation using PSpice. The
next section covers the essential skills needed to operate the Schematics.
Creating a Circuit
For a circuit to be analyzed by PSpice, we must take three steps: (1) cre-
ate the circuit, (2) simulate it, and (3) print or plot the results. In thissection, we learn how to create the circuit using the Schematics program.
Before we discuss how to use the Schematics capture, we need to
know how to use the mouse to select an object and perform an action.One uses the mouse in Schematics in conjunction with the keyboard toD.2A-22 Appendix D PSpice for Windowsale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-22

lowing terms to represent actions to be performed by the mouse:
•CLICKL : click the left button once to select an item.
•CLICKR : click the right button once to abort a mode.
•DCLICKL : double-click the left button to edit a selection or end
a mode.
•DCLICKR : double-click the right button to repeat an action.
•CLICKLH : click the left button, hold down, and move the mouse
to drag a selected item. Release the left button after the item hasbeen placed.
•DRAG : drag the mouse (without clicking) to move an item.
When the term “click” is used, it means that you quickly press and releasethe leftmouse button. To select an item requires CLICKL , while to per-
form an action requires DCLICKL. Also, to avoid writing “click” several
times, the menu to be clicked will be highlighted in bold. For example,“click Draw, click Get New Part” will be written as Draw/Get New
Part. Of course, we can always press the <Esc> key to abort any action.
Assuming that you are using Windows, you can access Pspice by
clicking the Start icon on the left-hand corner of your PC, drag the cursorto Programs, PSpice student; and to Schematics, as shown in Fig. D.1.
Alternatively, you have the PSpice icon on your screen. DCLICK on it.
Either way, a blank screen will appear as shown in Fig. D.2. The ﬁleAppendix D PSpice for Windows A-23ale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-23

ple, select the part R and click Edit/Rotate (or type <Ctrl R>). To
delete a part, CLICKL to select (highlight red) the part, then click
Edit/Cut (or press <Delete>).
Step 2: Wiring Parts Together
We complete the circuit by wiring the parts together. We ﬁrst select
Draw/Wire (or type <Ctrl-W>) to be in wiring mode. A pencil cursor
will appear in place of an arrow cursor. DRAG the pencil cursor to the
ﬁrst point you want to connect and CLICKL . Next, DRAG the pen-
cil cursor to the second point and CLICKL to change the dashed line
to a solid line. (Only solid lines are wires.) CLICKR to end the wiring
mode. To resume the wiring mode, press the <Space bar>. Repeat theabove procedure for each connection in the circuit until all the partsare wired. The wiring is not complete without adding a ground con-nection (part AGND) to a schematic; PSpice will not operate without
it. To verify that the parts are actually connected together, the Junctions
option available in the Options/Set Display Level menu should be in
the on position when wiring the parts. By default, the Junctions option
is marked with a checksign ( ✓) in the dialog box, indicating that it
is on.
Some of the connections have a black dot indicating a connection.
Although it is not necessary to have a dot where a wire joins a pin,90/H11034.A-24 Appendix D PSpice for Windows
name [Schematic1 p.1] next to PSpice Schematics is assigned to a cir-
cuit which is yet to be saved. You can change it by pulling down the
File menu.
To create a circuit using Schematics requires three steps: (1) placing
the parts or components of the circuit, (2) wiring the parts together toform the circuit, and (3) changing attributes of the parts.
Step 1: Placing the Parts
Each circuit part is retrieved by following this procedure:
•Select Draw/Get New Part to pull down the Draw menu (or type
<Ctrl-G>).
•Use scroll bar to select the part (or type the part name, e.g., R forresistor, in the PartName box). Figures D.3 to D.5 show some part
names and symbols for circuit elements and independent voltageand current sources.
•Click Place & Close (or press <Enter>).
•DRAG part to the desired location on the screen.
•CLICKR to terminate the placement mode.ale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-24

Example D.1 Draw the circuit in Fig. D.7 using Schematics.
Solution:
We will follow the three steps mentioned above. We begin by double-
clicking the Schematics icon. This provides us with a blank screen asIt is always expedient to number the
nodes by numbering the wires. Other-wise, 
Schematics will label the nodes
its own way, and one may not under-stand which node is which in theoutput results.

appears, make sure the wire overlaps the pin.
If you make a mistake, you can delete the part or wire by 
highlighting it (select CLICKL) and pressing the <Delete> key.Typing <Ctrl-L> will erase the fragments that are not really on the
shematic.
Step 3: Changing Attributes of Parts
As shown in Figs. D.3 to D.5, each component has an attribute in addi-tion to its symbol. Attributes are the labels for parts. Each attribute con-sists of a name and its designated value. For example, R and VSRC
are the names of resistor and voltage source (dc, ac, or transientsource), while 2k and are the designated values of the
resistor and voltage source, respectively.
As parts are placed on the screen, they are automatically
assigned names by successive numbers (R1, R2, R3, etc.). Also,some parts are assigned some predetermined values. For example,all resistors are placed horizontally and assigned a value of We may need to change the attributes (names and values) of a part.
Although there are several ways of changing the attributes, the fol-lowing is one simple way.
To change the name R3 to RX, for example, DCLICKL on the
text R3 to bring up the Edit Reference Designator dialog box of
Fig. D.6(a). Type the new name RX and click the OKbutton to accept
the change. The same procedure can be used to change VDC to V1 orwhatever.
To change the value 1k to 10Meg, for example, DCLICKL on
the 1k attribute (not the symbol) to open up the Set Attribute Value
dialog box of Fig. D.6(b). Type the new value 10Meg (no spacebetween 10 and Meg) and click the OK button to accept the change.
Similarly, to change the default value 0V to 15kV for voltage sourceVDC, DCLICKL the symbol for VDC to bring up the PartName dia-
log box. DCLICKL on the attribute and type 15kV in the
value box. For convenience, one can express numbers with the scalefactors in Table D.1. For example, can be written as 66N
or 0.066U.
Except for the ground, which is automatically assigned node 0,
every node is either given a name (or number) or is assigned one inthe netlist. A node is labeled by giving a name to a wire connected tothat node. DCLICKL the wire to open up the Set Attribute Value dia-
log box, and type the label.
To obtain a hard copy of the screen/schematic, click File/Print/OK .
To save the schematic created, select File/Save As and type Filename.
Click OK or press <Enter>. This creates a ﬁle named “ﬁlename” and
saves it with extension .sch.6.6/H1100310

to create the circuit in Fig. D.7.To place the voltage source, we need to:
1. Click Draw/Get New Part (or type <Ctrl-G>).
2. Type VSRC in the Part Browser Basic box.
3. Click OK (or type <Enter>).
4.DRAG the part to the desired location on the screen.
5.CLICKL to place VSRC and CLICKR to terminate
placement mode.
At this point, only the voltage source V1 in Fig. D.8(a) is shown on the screen, highlighted red. To place the resistors, we need to:
1. Click Draw/Get New Part.
2. Type R in the Part Browser Basic box.
3. Click OK.
4.DRAG resistor to R1’s location on the screen.
5.CLICKL to place R1.
6.CLICKL to place R2 and CLICKR to terminate placement mode.
7.DRAG R2 to its location.
8.Edit/Rotate (or type <Ctrl-R>) to rotate R2.
At this point, the three parts have been created as shown in Fig. D.8(a).The next step is to connect the parts by wiring. To do this:
1. Click Draw/Wire to be in wiring mode, indicated by the
pencil cursor.
2.DRAG the pencil cursor to the top of V1.
3.CLICKL to join the wire to the top of V1.
4.DRAG the dotted wire to the top corner.
5.CLICKL to turn wire segment solid, and anchor at corner.
6.DRAG dotted wire to left of R1.
7.CLICKL to turn wire segment solid and anchor to left of R1.
8.CLICKR to end placement mode.
Follow the same steps to connect R1 with R2 and V1 with R2.
(You can resume the wiring mode by pressing <Space bar>.) At thispoint, we have the circuit in Fig. D.8(b), except that the ground symbolis missing. We insert the ground by taking the following steps:
1. Click Draw/Get New Part.
2. Type AGND in the Part Browser Basic box.
3. Click OK.
4.DRAG the part to the desired location on the screen.
5.CLICKL to place AGND and CLICKR to terminate
placement mode.
The last thing to be done is to change or assign values to the attributes.To assign the attribute 12V to V1, we take these steps:
1.DCLICKL on the V1 symbol to open up the PartName
dialog box.
2.DCLICKL on the attribute.
3. Type (or simply 12) in the Value box.
4. Click Save Attr.

DC Analysis
DC analysis is one of the standard analyses that we can perform usingPSpice . Other standard analyses include transient, AC, and Fourier.
Under DC analysis, there are two kinds of simulation that PSpice can
execute: DC nodal analysis and DC sweep.
1. DC Nodal Analysis
PSpice allows dc nodal analysis to be performed on sources with an
attribute of the form DC value and provides the dc voltage at eachnode of the circuit and dc branch currents if required. To view dc nodevoltages and branch currents requires adding two kinds of additionalparts, shown in Fig. D.11. The symbol VIEWPOINT is connected toeach node at which the voltage is to be viewed, while the symbolIPROBE is connected in the branch where the current is to be dis-played. This necessitates modifying the schematic. For example, let usconsider placing voltage VIEWPOINTS and current IPROBES to theschematic in Fig. D.8(c). To add VIEWPOINTS, we take the follow-ing steps:
1. Click Draw/Get New Part (or type <Ctrl-G>).
2. Type VIEWPOINT in the Part Browser Basic box.
3. Click OK (or type <Enter>).
4.DRAG to locate VIEWPOINT above V1 and CLICKL .
5.DRAG to locate VIEWPOINT above R2 and CLICKL .

A netlist can be generated manually or
automatically by 
Schematics .
There are two kinds of common errors
in PSpice : (1) errors involving wiring of
the circuit, and (2) errors that occurduring simulation.Figure D.12 shows the two voltage VIEWPOINTS. Since the IPROBE
symbol must be connected in series with a branch element, we need tomove R2 down by clicking and dragging R2 and the wires. Once thisis done, we add IPROBE as follows:
1. Click Draw/Get New Part (or type <Ctrl-G>).
2. Type IPROBE in the Part Browser Basic box.
3. Click OK (or type <Enter>).
4.DRAG to locate IPROBE above R2 and CLICKL .
5.CLICKR to end placement mode.
6. Use wiring to join all gaps.
The schematic becomes that shown in Fig. D.12. We are ready to sim-ulate the circuit. At this point, we must save the schematic— PSpice
will not run without ﬁrst saving the schematic to be simulated. Beforelearning how to run PSpice, note the following points:
1.There must be a reference node or ground connection (partAGND) in the schematic. Any node can be used as ground, andthe voltages at other nodes will be measured with respect to theselected ground.
2. Dependent sources are found in the Parts library. Obtain them by
selecting Draw/Get New Part and typing the part name. Figure D.13
shows the part name for each type, with the gain. Eis a voltage-
controlled voltage source with gain e ; Fis a current-controlled
current source with gain f ; Gis a voltage-controlled current source
with a transconductance gain g; and H is a current-controlled volt-
age source with transresistance gain h.
3. By convention, we assume in dc analysis that all capacitors are
open circuits and all inductors are short circuits.
We run PSpice by clicking Analysis/Simulate. This invokes the
electric rule check (ERC), which generates the netlist. The ERC per-
forms a connectivity check on the schematic before creating the netlist.
The netlist is a list describing the operational behavior of each com-ponent in the circuit and its connections. Each line in the netlist rep-resents a single component of the circuit. The netlist can be examinedby clicking Analysis/Examine Netlist from the Schematics window.
If there are errors in the schematic, an error window will appear. Click
OK (or type <Enter>) to display the error list. After noting the errors,
exit from the error list and go back to Schematics to correct the errors.
If no errors are found, the system automatically enters PSpice and per-
forms the simulation (nodal analysis). When the analysis is complete,the program displays Bias point calculated , and creates the result/
output ﬁle with extension .out.
To examine the output ﬁle, click Analysis/Examine Output from
the Schematics window (or click File/Examine Output from the
PSpice window). To print the output ﬁle, click File/Print, and to exit
the output ﬁle, click File/Exit .
We can also examine the results of the simulation by looking at
the values displayed on the VIEWPOINTS and IPROBES parts of theschematics after the simulation is complete. The values displayed with
VIEWPOINTS and IPROBES should be the same as those in the out-put ﬁle.A-28 Appendix D PSpice for Windowsale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-28

2. DC Sweep
DC nodal analysis allows simulation for DC sources with ﬁxed volt-
ages or currents. DC sweep provides more ﬂexibility in that it allowsthe calculation of node voltages and branch currents of a circuit whena source is swept over a range of values. As in nodal analysis, weassume capacitors to be open circuits and inductors to be short circuits.
Suppose we desire to perform a DC sweep of voltage source V1
in Fig. D.12 from 0 to 20 volts in 1-volt increments. We proceed asfollows:
1. Click Analysis/Setup .
2.CLICKL DC Sweep button.
3. Click Name box and type V1.
4. Click Start Value box and type 
5. Click End Value box and type 
6. Click Increment box and type 
7. Click OK to end the DC Sweep dialog box and save parameters.
8. Click Close to end the Analysis Setup menu.
Figure D.14 shows the DC Sweep dialog box. Notice that the default
setting is V oltage Source for the Swept Var. Type , while it is Linear for
Sweep Type. If needed, other options can be selected by clicking theappropriate buttons.1.20.0.Appendix D PSpice for Windows A-29
Figure D.14
DC sweep analysis dialog box.
To run DC sweep analysis, click Analysis/Simulate. Schematics
will create a netlist and then run PSpice if no errors are found. If errors
are found in the schematic, check for them in the Error List and cor-
rect them as usual. If no errors are found, the data generated by PSpice
is passed to Orcad PSpice . The Orcad PSpice window will appear, dis-
playing a graph in which the X axis is by default set to the DC sweep
variable and range, and the Y axis is blank for now. To display somespeciﬁc plots, click Trace/Add in the Orcad PSpice menu to open the
Add Traces dialog box. The box contains traces, which are the output
variables (node voltages and branch currents) in the data ﬁle availablefor display. Select the traces to be displayed by clicking or typing them,and click OK. The selected traces will be plotted and displayed on theale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-29

To delete a trace, click the trace name in the legend of the plot to high-
light it and click Edit/Delete (or press <Delete>).
It is important to understand how to interpret the traces. We must
interpret the voltage and current variables according to the passive signconvention. As parts are initially placed horizontally in a schematic asshown typically in Fig. D.3, the left-hand terminal is named pin 1 whilethe right-hand terminal is pin 2. When a component (say R1) is rotatedcounterclockwise once, pin 2 would be on the top, since rotation is aboutpin 1. Therefore, if current enters through pin 2, the current I(R1)through R1 would be negative. In other words, positive current impliesthat the current enters through pin 1, and negative current means that thecurrent enters through pin 2. As for voltage variables, they are alwayswith respect to the ground. For example, V(R1:2) is the voltage (withrespect to the ground) at pin 2 of resistor R1; V(V1: /H11001) is the voltage
(with respect to the ground) at the positive terminal of voltage sourceV1; and V(E2:1) is the voltage at pin 1 of component E2 with respectto ground, regardless of the polarity.A-30 Appendix D PSpice for Windows

Transient Analysis
In PSpice, transient analysis is generally used to examine the behavior
of a waveform (voltage or current) as time varies. Transient analysis
solves some differential equations describing a circuit and obtains volt-ages and currents versus time. Transient analysis is also used to obtainFourier analysis. To perform transient analysis on a circuit using PSpiceD.4
Transient analysis is used to view the
transient response of inductors and
capacitors.ale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-33

usually involves these steps: (1) drawing the circuit, (2) providing spec-
iﬁcations, and (3) simulating the circuit.
1. Drawing the Circuit
In order to run a transient analysis on a circuit, the circuit must ﬁrstbe created using Schematics and the source must be speciﬁed. PSpice
has several time-varying functions or sources that enhance the per-formance of transient analysis. Sources used in the transient analysisinclude:
•VSIN, ISIN: damped sinusoidal voltage or current source, e.g.,
•VPULSE, IPULSE: voltage or current pulse.
•VEXP, IEXP: voltage or current exponential source, e.g., 
•VPWL, IPWL: piecewise linear voltage or current function, whichcan be used to create an arbitrary waveform.
It is expedient to take a close look at these functions.
VSIN is the exponentially damped sinusoidal voltage source, for
example,
(D.1)
The VSIN source has the following attributes, which are illustrated inFig. D.25 and compared with Eq. (D.1):

Attributes TD, DF, and PHASE are set to 0 by default but can be
assigned other values if necessary. What has been said about VSIN isalso true for ISIN.
The VPULSE source has the following attributes, which are por-

The exponential voltage source VEXP has the following attributes,

The piecewise linear voltage source VPWL, such as shown in
Fig. D.28, requires specifying pairs of TN, VN, where VN is the volt-
age at time TN for . For example, for the function inFig. D.29, we will need to specify the attributes , ,
, , , , and , .
To obtain information about other sources, click Help/Search for
Help on . . . and type in the name of the source. To add a source to the
schematic, take the following steps:
1. Select Draw/Get New Part.
2. Type the name of the source.3. Click OK and DRAG the symbol to the desired location.
4.DCLICKL the symbol of the source to open up the PartName
dialog box.
5. For each attribute, DCLICKL on the attribute, enter the value, and
click Save Attr to accept changes.
6. Click OK to accept new attributes.
In step 5, the attributes may not be shown on the schematic after enter-ing their values. To display an attribute, select Change Display/Both
Name and Value in the PartName dialog box.
In addition to specifying the source to be used in transient analysis,
there may be need to set initial conditions on capacitors and inductorsin the circuit. To do so, DCLICKL the part symbol to bring up the
PartName dialog box, click IC/H11005and type in the initial condition. The
IC attribute allows for setting the initial conditions on a capacitor orinductor. The default value of IC is 0. The attributes of open/closeswitches (with part names Sw_tClose and Sw_tOpen) can be changedin a similar manner.
2. Providing Speciﬁcations
After the circuit is drawn and the source is speciﬁed with its attrib-utes, we need to add some speciﬁcations for the transient analysis.V4/H11005/H11002 2 T4/H110058 V3/H110054 T3/H110056 V2/H110054 T2/H110052V1/H110050 T1/H110050N/H110051, 2, p, 10A-36 Appendix D PSpice for Windows

To obtain the Fourier component of a
signal, we enable the Fourier option in
the Transient Analysis dialog box.
Chapter 17 has more on this.For example, suppose we want the analysis to run the simulation from
0 to 10 ms with a print interval of 2 ns; we enter these speciﬁcationsas follows:
1.Select Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the T ransient Analysis
dialog box.
2.CLICKL Print Step and type 2 ns.
3.CLICKL Final Time and type 10 ms.
4.CLICKL Step Ceiling and type 5 /H9262s.
5.CLICKL OK/Close to accept speciﬁcations.
These speciﬁcations control the simulation and the display of outputvariables. Final Time speciﬁes how long the simulation should run. In
other words, the simulation runs from to Print
Step refers to the time interval the print part will print out; it controls
how often simulation results are written to the output ﬁle. The valueof Print Step can be any value less than the Final Time, but it cannot
be zero. Step Ceiling is the maximum time between simulation points;
specifying its value is optional. By selecting 10 ms as Final Time and
as Step Ceiling, the simulation will have a minimum of
points. When Step Ceiling is unspeciﬁed, PSpice
selects its own internal time step—the time between simulation points.The time step is selected as large as possible to reduce simulationtime. If the user has no idea of what the plot may look like, it is rec-ommended that the value of Step Ceiling be unspeciﬁed. If the plot is
jagged as a result of a large time step assumed by PSpice, the user
may now specify a Step Ceiling that will smooth the plot. Keep in
mind that a smaller value gives more points in the simulation but takesmore time.
3. Simulating the Circuit
After the circuit is drawn, the speciﬁcations for the transient analy-sis are given, and the circuit is saved, we are ready to simulateit. To perform transient analysis, we select Analysis/Simulate .If
there are no errors, the Orcad PSpice window will automatically
appear. As usual, the time axis (or X axis) is drawn but no curvesare drawn yet. Select Trace/Add and click on the variables to be
displayed.
An alternative way of displaying the results is to use markers.
Although there are many types of markers, we will discuss onlyvoltage and current markers. A voltage marker is used to displayvoltage at a node relative to ground; a current marker is fordisplaying current through a component pin. To place a voltagemarker at a node, take the following steps while in the Schematics
window:
1. Select Markers/Mark Voltage/Level.
2.DRAG the voltage marker to the desired node.
3.CLICKL to place the marker and CLICKR to end the placement
mode.
This will cause two things to happen immediately. The voltage markerbecomes part of the circuit and the appropriate node voltage is auto-matically displayed by the Orcad PSpice window when the Schematics is10 ms/5 ms/H1100520005 mst/H11005Final Time. t/H110050Appendix D PSpice for Windows A-37ale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-37

AC Analysis/Frequency Response
Using AC sweep, PSpice can perform AC analysis of a circuit for a sin-
gle frequency or over a range of frequencies in increments that can vary
linearly, by decade, or by octave. In AC sweep, one or more sourcesD.5ale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-40

are swept over a range of frequencies while the voltages and currents
of the circuit are calculated. Thus, we use AC sweep both for phasoranalysis and for frequency response analysis: it will output Bode gainand phase plots. (Keep in mind that a phasor is a complex quantitywith real and imaginary parts or with magnitude and phase.)
While transient analysis is done in the time domain, AC analysis is
performed in the frequency domain. For example, if 
transient analysis can be used to display as a function of time,
whereas AC sweep will give the magnitude as 10 and phase as .Toperform AC sweep requires taking three steps similar to those for
transient analysis: (1) drawing the circuit, (2) providing speciﬁcations,and (3) simulating the circuit.
1. Drawing the Circuit
We ﬁrst draw the circuit using Schematics and specify the source(s).
Sources used in AC sweep are AC sources V AC and IAC. The sourcesand attributes are entered into the Schematics as stated in the previous
section. For each independent source, we must specify its magnitudeand phase.
2. Providing Speciﬁcations
Before simulating the circuit, we need to add some speciﬁcations forAC sweep. For example, suppose we want a linear sweep at frequen-cies 50, 100, and 150 Hz. We enter these parameters as follows:
1. Select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep to open up the dialog box for
AC Sweep.
2.CLICKL Linear for the X axis to have a linear scale.
3. Type 3 in the Total Pts box.
4. Type 50 in the Start Freq box.
5. Type 150 in the End Freq box.
6.CLICKL OK/Close to accept speciﬁcations.
Alinear sweep implies that simulation points are spread uniformly
between the starting and ending frequencies. Note that the Start Freq
cannot be zero because 0 Hz corresponds to DC analysis. If we wantthe simulation to be done at a single frequency, we enter 1 in step 3and the same frequency in steps 4 and 5. If we want the AC sweep tosimulate the circuit from 1 Hz to 10 MHz at 10 points per decade, weCLICKL on Decade in step 2 to make the Xaxis logarithmic, enter
10 in the T otal Pts box in step 3, enter 1 in the Start Freq box, and
enter 10Meg in the End Freq box. Keep in mind that a decade is a fac-
tor of 10. In this case, a decade is from 1 Hz to 10 Hz, from 10 Hz to100, from 100 to 1 kHz, and so forth.
3. Simulating the Circuit
After providing the necessary speciﬁcations and saving the circuit, weperform the AC sweep by selecting Analysis/Simulate . If no errors
are encountered, the circuit is simulated. At the end of the simulation,the system displays AC analysis ﬁnished and creates an output ﬁle
with extension .out. Also, the Orcad PSpice program will automatically
run if there are no errors. The frequency axis (or Xaxis) is drawn but
no curves are shown yet. Select Trace/Add from the Orcad PSpice
menu bar and click on the variables to be displayed. We may also use40/H11034y
s 40/H11034),cos(377 t/H11001 vs/H1100510Appendix D PSpice for Windows A-41ale29559_appD.qxd  07/17/2008  09:18 AM  Page A-41

To generate Bode plots involves using
the AC sweep and the dB command in
Orcad PSpice .current or voltage markers to display the traces as explained in the pre-
vious section. To use advanced markers such as vdb, idb, vphase ,
iphase ,vreal , and ireal , select Markers/Mark Advanced.
In case the resolution of the trace is not good enough, we may
need to check the data points to see if they are enough. To do so, selectTools/Options/Mark Data Points/OK in the Orcad PSpice menu and
the data points will be displayed. If necessary, we can improve the res-olution by increasing the value of the entry in the Total Pts box in the
Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and Noise Analysis dialog box for AC
sweep.
Bode plots are separate plots of magnitude and phase versus fre-
quency. To obtain Bode plots, it is common to use an AC source, sayV1, with 1 volt magnitude and zero phase. After we have selectedAnalysis/Simulate and have the Orcad PSpice program running, we
can display the magnitude and phase plots as mentioned above. Sup-pose we want to display a Bode magnitude plot of V(4). We selectTrace/Add and type dB(V(4)) in Trace Command box. dB(V(4)) is
equivalent to 20log(V(4)), and because the magnitude of V1 or V(R1:1)is unity, dB(V(4)) actually corresponds to dB(V(4)/V(R1:1)), which isthe gain. Adding the trace dB(V(4)) will give a Bode magnitude/gainplot with the axis in dB.
Once a plot is obtained in the Orcad PSpice window, we can add
labels to it for documentation purposes. To add a title to the plot, selectEdit/Modify Title in the Orcad PSpice menu and type the title in the
dialog box. To add a label to the Yaxis, select Plot/Y Axis Settings,
type the label, and CLICKL OK. Add a label to the Xaxis in the same
manner.
As an alternative approach, we can avoid running the Orcad
PSpice program by using pseudocomponents to send results to the
output ﬁle. Pseudocomponents are like parts that can be inserted intoa schematic as if they were circuit elements, but they do not corre-spond to circuit elements. We can add them to the circuit for speci-fying initial conditions or for output control. In fact, we have alreadyused two pseudocomponents, VIEWPOINT and IPROBE, for DCanalysis. Other important pseudocomponents and their usage areshown in Fig. D.40 and listed in Table D.2. The pseudocomponentsare added to the schematic. To add a pseudocomponent, selectDraw/Get New Parts in the Schematics window, select the pseudo-
component, place it at the desired location, and add the appropriateattributes as usual. Once the pseudocomponents are added to theschematic, we select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter the spec-
iﬁcations for the AC sweep, and ﬁnally, select Analysis/Simulate to
perform AC sweep. If no errors are encountered, the voltages and cur-rents speciﬁed in the pseudocomponents will be saved in the outputfile. We obtain the output ﬁle by selecting Analysis/Examine Outputin the Schematics window.YA-42 Appendix D PSpice for Windows

MATLAB has become a powerful tool of technical professionals world-
wide. The term MATLAB is an abbreviation for MAT rix LABoratory,
implying that MATLAB is a computational tool that uses matrices and
vectors (or arrays) to carry out numerical analysis, signal processing,
and scientiﬁc visualization tasks. Because MATLAB uses matrices as
its fundamental building blocks, one can write mathematical expres-sions involving matrices just as easily as one would on paper. MATLAB
is available for Macintosh, Unix, and Windows operating systems. Astudent version of MATLAB is available for personal computers (PCs).

the answer as 64. Finally, the third line sets eequal to the square root of
dat and divides by 10. MATLAB prints the answer as 0.8. Other mathe-
matical functions, listed in Table E.1, can be used similarly to how the func-
tionsqrt is used here. Table E.1 provides just a tiny sample of MATLAB
functions. Others can be obtained from the on-line help. To get help, type

Try the following examples:
>> 3^(log10(25.6))
>> y = 2* sin(pi/3)>> exp(y+4-1)
In addition to operating on mathematical functions, MATLAB
allows one to work easily with vectors and matrices. A vector (or array)
is a special matrix with one row or one column. For example,
>> a = [1 -3 6 10 -8 11 14];is a row vector. Deﬁning a matrix is similar to deﬁning a vector. For
example, a matrix can be entered as
>> A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]or as>> A = [ 1 2 3
456
789 ]
In addition to the arithmetic operations that can be performed on a
matrix, the operations in Table E.2 can be implemented.
Using the operations in Table E.2, we can manipulate matrices as
follows:
>> B = A’
B = 
147
258369
>> C = A + B
C = 
26 1 0

Note that not all matrices can be inverted. A matrix can be inverted if
and only if its determinant is nonzero. Special matrices, variables, andconstants are listed in Table E.3. For example, type
>> eye(3)
ans = 
100010001
to get a identity matrix.
Plotting
To plot using MATLAB is easy. For a two-dimensional plot, use the
plot command with two arguments as follows:
>> plot(xdata,ydata)where xdata and ydata are vectors of the same length containing
the data to be plotted.
For example, suppose we want to plot y = 10*sin(2*pi*x)
from 0to 5*pi. We will proceed with the following commands:
%xisavector,0 <= x <= 5*pi,incrementsofpi/100
%createsavectory
%createstheplot
With this, MATLAB responds with the plot in Fig. E.1.
MATLAB will let you graph multiple plots together and distin-
guish them with different colors. This is obtained with the format
plot(xdata, ydata, ‘color’) , where the color is indicated
by using a character string from the options listed in Table E.4.
For example,
>> plot(x1,y1,‘r’,x2,y2,‘b’,x3,y3,‘--’);
will graph data (x1, y1) in red, data (x2, y2) in blue, and data
(x3, y3) in dashed line all on the same plot.3/H110033Appendix E MATLAB A-49

MATLAB also allows for logarithm scaling. Rather than using the
plot command, we use
loglog log(y) versuslog(x)
semilogx y versuslog(x)
semilogy log(y) versusx
Three-dimensional plots are drawn using the functions mesh
and meshdom (mesh domain). For example, to draw the graph of 
z=x*exp( - x^2 - y^2) over the domain -1 < x,y<1 ,w e
type the following commands:
>> xx = -1:.1:1;
>> yy = xx;>> [x,y] = meshgrid(xx,yy);>> z = x.*exp(-x.^2 -y.^2);>> mesh(z);

tiplication.) The result is shown in Fig. E.2.A-50 Appendix E MATLABale29559_appE.qxd  07/17/2008  09:35 AM  Page A-50

So far we have used MATLAB as a calculator. You can also use
MATLAB to create your own program. The command line editing in
MATLAB can be inconvenient if one has several lines to execute. To
avoid this problem, you can create a program that is a sequence of
statements to be executed. If you are in the Command window, clickFile/New/M -ﬁles to open a new ﬁle in the MATLAB Editor/Debugger
or simple text editor. Type the program and save it in a ﬁle with anextension .m, sayﬁlename.m ; it is for this reason that it is called
an M-ﬁle. Once the program is saved as an M-ﬁle, exit the Debuggerwindow. You are now back in the Command window. Type the ﬁlewithout the extension .mto get results. For example, the plot that was
made in Fig. E.2 can be improved by adding title and labels and beingtyped as an M-ﬁle called example1.m.
%xisavector,0<=x<=5*pi,incrementsofpi/100
%createsavector y
%createtheplot
%labelthexaxis
%labeltheyaxis
%titletheplot
%addgrid
Once the ﬁle is saved as example1.m and you exit the text editor,
type
>> example1in the Command window and hit Enter to obtain the result shown in
Fig. E.3.
To allow ﬂow control in a program, certain relational and logical
operators are necessary. They are shown in Table E.5. Perhaps the most
commonly used ﬂow control statements are for and if. The forAppendix E MATLAB A-51ale29559_appE.qxd  07/17/2008  09:35 AM  Page A-51

statement is used to create a loop or a repetitive procedure and has the
general form
forx = array
[commands]
endThe ifstatement is used when certain conditions need to be met before
an expression is executed. It has the general form ifexpression
[commands if expression is True]
else
[commands if expression is False]
end
For example, suppose we have an array y(x) and we want to
determine the minimum value of y and its corresponding index x. This
can be done by creating an M-ﬁle as shown here.% example2.m
% This program ﬁnds the minimum y value and
its corresponding x index
x=[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10];%the nth term in y
y=[3 9 15 8 1 0 -2 4 12 5];
min1= y(1); for k = 1:10
min2 = y(k);if(min2 < min1)
min1 = min2;xo = x(k);
else
min1 = min1;
end
enddiarymin1, xodiary off
Note the use of the for and ifstatements. When this program is
saved as example2.m, we execute it in the Command window and
obtain the minimum value of y as -2and the corresponding value of
xas 7, as expected.
>> example2
min1 =
-2
xo =
7A-52 Appendix E MATLABale29559_appE.qxd  07/17/2008  09:35 AM  Page A-52

If we are not interested in the corresponding index, we could do the
same thing using the command
>>min(y)
The following tips are helpful in working effectively with
MATLAB :
•Comment your M-file by adding lines beginning with a % 
character.
•To suppress output, end each command with a semicolon ( ;); you
may remove the semicolon when debugging the ﬁle.
•Press the up and down arrow keys to retrieve previously executedcommands.
•If your expression does not ﬁt on one line, use an ellipse atthe end of the line and continue on the next line. For example,MATLAB considers
y = sin(x + log10(2x + 3)) + cos(x + ...log10(2x + 3));
as one line of expression.
•Keep in mind that variable and function names are case sensitive.

For Example E.4.AC Circuit Analysis
Using MATLAB in ac circuit analysis is similar to how MATLAB is
used for dc circuit analysis. We must ﬁrst apply nodal or mesh analy-
sis to the circuit and then use MATLAB to solve the resulting system
of equations. However, the circuit is in the frequency domain, and weare dealing with phasors or complex numbers. So in addition to whatwe learned in Section E.2, we need to understand how MATLAB han-
dles complex numbers.
MATLAB expresses complex numbers in the usual manner, except
that the imaginary part can be either or representing . Thus,
can be written in MATLAB as 3-j4 ,3-j*4 ,3-i4 , or 
3-I*4 . Here are the other complex functions:
abs(A) Absolute value of magnitude of A
angle(A) Angle of A in radians
conj(A) Complex conjugate of A
imag(A) Imaginary part of A
real(A) Real part of A
Keep in mind that an angle in radians must be multiplied by toconvert it to degrees, and vice versa. Also, the transpose operator ( ‘)
gives the complex conjugate transpose, whereas the dot-transpose ( . ‘)
transposes an array without conjugating it.180/H20862p3/H11002j41/H110021

With the explanation previously given, we develop the MATLAB code
as shown here.

and then plot the data as we did in Section E.1. However, there is
an easy way that allows us to use one of two MATLAB commands:
freqs and bode. For each command, we must ﬁrst specify H(s)
as num and den,where num and den are the vectors of coefﬁcients
of the numerator N(s) and denominator D(s) in descending powers
of s, i.e., from the highest power to the constant term. The general
form of the bode function is
bode(num, den, range);
where range is a speciﬁed frequency interval for the plot. If range is
omitted, MATLAB automatically selects the frequency range. The range
could be linear or logarithmic. For example, for 
with 50 plot points, we can specify a linear range as
range = linspace(1,1000,50);
For a logarithmic range with and 100 plot
points in between, we specify range as
range = logspace(-2,4,100);For the freqs function, the general form is
hs = freqs(num, den, range);where hsis the frequency response (generally complex). We still need
to calculate the magnitude in decibels asmag=20*log10(abs(hs))and phase in degrees asphase = angle(hs)*180/piand plot them, whereas the bode function does it all at once. We illus-
trate with an example.10

Appendix F
KCIDE for Circuits
Engineers of the twenty-ﬁrst century will need to be able to work in
a“knowledge capturing integrated design environment” (known as
KCIDE). Essentially, engineers will go to their computer where theywill do their work on a platform, much like Windows, where their var-ious software packages, laboratory work, and other support softwarepackages (such as Word ) will all come together and interact with
each other to help them with their work. These platforms will capturethe work being done by the engineer and make the data available tobe used in any manner the engineer chooses (such as preliminarydesign reports, user manuals, papers, books, proposals, or requests forproposals).
Adetailed presentation of all the elements associated with learn-
ing how to work in such an environment is beyond the scope of thisbook. However, a platform to begin the process of training engineersto work in this environment is included in this textbook. KCIDE for
Circuits was designed to assist the circuits student to learn how to work
in a simpliﬁed KCIDE environment designed especially for electricalcircuits students. The software that is used in the platform includesPSpice, MATLAB , Excel, Word , and PowerPoint.
In this appendix, we will help you to understand the KCIDE for
Circuits platform and how to use it. The software can be obtained,
free of any charges, from the website http://KCIDE.FennResearch.org.More details and examples are also included at the website. In addi-tion, we will also have support services available at the website.
How to Work with KCIDE for Circuits
The structure of the platform and how it is effectively used followsthe problem-solving process used throughout the text. This is essen-tially a systems approach to problem solving that uses a structuredprocess to capture your work and present it in two different formats.It will be helpful to work through an example to see how to use theplatform.F.1
A-65
Use the KCIDE for Circuits platform to solve Example 3.2.
Solution:
Opening the software, we see the screen shown in Fig. F.1, where wedeﬁne a new project. Although we can name the project anyway weExample F.1ale29559_appF.qxd  07/17/2008  09:40 AM  Page A-65

wish to, we name it KCIDE Example F-1 050626 (see Fig. F.2). Note
that the last six digits are: year/month/day. The reason for this is thatif we create different ﬁles corresponding to different dates, the ﬁles willalways appear in chronological order. A-66 Appendix F KCIDE for Circuits
Figure F.1
Creating a new project in KCIDE for Circuits.
Figure F.2
Naming the project.
We now enter the problem statement into the screen shown in
Fig. F.3. After we have entered the problem statement, we can click on
the button to Open PSpice. The next screen, Fig. F.4, shows what is
seen when the Open PSpice button is clicked. To open the PSpice
schematic capture, we need to click on the page 1 icon. In Schematic,we create the circuit representing our problem. This is shown inFig. F.5.
We now need to enter all we know about the problem by entering
our problem analysis into the text box and then identifying the numberale29559_appF.qxd  07/17/2008  09:40 AM  Page A-66

of unknown nodes and loops for the circuit (see Fig. F.6). We continue
this process by going to the next screen and entering the requestedinformation (see Fig. F.7).A-68 Appendix F KCIDE for Circuits
We now proceed to selecting the method of solution. We do this
by entering the requested information into the screen shown in Fig. F.8.
Now we can develop the equations that will generate a solution forthe problem. Since nodal analysis is required for the solution for thenode voltages, all we need to do is to write the nodal equations.Once we have the appropriate equations, as shown in Fig. F.9, we canselect a solution technique. In this case we chose Excel to solve oursimultaneous equations.Figure F.6

Now, when we go to the next screen, the Evaluate portion of the
solution, we actually open PSpice again. We need to open page 1 to
retrieve our original circuit (see Fig. F.10). Once we have our original
PSpice circuit, we need to prepare it for solving for our unknowns. The
ﬁrst step in this task is to go to the PSpice button and select New
Simulation Proﬁle (see Fig. F.11).
We next need to assign a name to the new simulation proﬁle
(Fig. F.12). Clicking on the Create button produces the screen shownin Fig. F.13. For this problem, we select Bias Point for the Analysistype.
Clicking on OK returns the screen to the original condition. Now
we go to the PSpice button and select Run from the dropdown menu,Appendix F KCIDE for Circuits A-69

can immediately see that the voltages agree with the solution we
obtained by using nodal analysis. Clicking on Next leads to our beingasked, as in Fig. F.16, if we have any graphics to export. For thisproblem, we have no graphs.Appendix F KCIDE for Circuits A-71

We are now approaching the end of the process. We are asked to
comment about the solution, Fig. F.17. And, we are asked if the
answers agree with the PSpice solution. The answers do agree and
we can proceed to determining what we want to export, Fig. F.18.We can generate Word and/or PowerPoint ﬁles, Fig. F.19. In this case,
we select both but will only show the output of the Word ﬁle, Fig.
