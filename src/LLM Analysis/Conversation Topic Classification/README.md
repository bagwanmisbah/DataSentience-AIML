# ðŸ§  Conversation Topic Classification

This project classifies text prompts (e.g., questions or commands) into predefined categories like:
- Translation Request
- Coding Query
- Personal Question
- Career Advice
- General Knowledge
- Technical Support
- ...and more

It enables downstream applications to understand user intent and organize or route conversations accordingly.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Labeling** â€“ Raw prompts are heuristically labeled using keyword rules in `preprocess.py`.
2. **Training** â€“ A logistic regression model is trained on TF-IDF features using scikit-learn (`train.py`).
3. **Inference** â€“ New prompts are classified in real-time using the trained model (`predict.py`).

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- TfidfVectorizer
- LogisticRegression
- joblib

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

The model achieves strong precision and recall across most classes. You can evaluate on the full dataset using:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## ðŸ§ª Quick Inference Example

```bash
python predict.py
```

Input:
```
Prompt: How do I debug this Python error?
```

Output:
```
Predicted Topic: Coding Query
```
